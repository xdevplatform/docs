[Typefully](https://typefully.com/) is very popular among creators, agencies, and teams for its minimal yet powerful interface, with more than 200k registered users. Among social media scheduling app, it’s the one that offers the simplest and most complete publishing and scheduling experience for X, and also the one with the best high-fidelity preview of how the content looks after publishing.

## The Challenge

Typefully was born a tool to write threads on Twitter, before it was rebranded as X. As users of the X API for many years now, they’ve always followed and updated X API developments closely to provide the best possible experience to their users, and adopt the latest features very quickly. By having a close relationship with X, Typefully has been able to support new X features quickly and offer a very complete publishing experience to their users.

## The Solution

[Typefully](https://typefully.com/) leverages several key features of the X API to power their core functionality, ensuring seamless publishing, analytics, and scheduling for their users.

For **post publishing and scheduling**, we rely on POST /2/tweets to support all post types—text, media, polls, and long-form posts—along with advanced thread management, auto-retries, and quote tweet handling. Typefully’s scheduling system integrates deeply with X, enabling timezone-aware posting, queue management, and automation features like auto-retweets and follow-ups.

**Analytics** is another key pillar, utilizing GET /2/tweets to provide real-time engagement tracking, historical data imports, and insights such as impressions, engagement rates, and link clicks. This data — 1M\+ posts processed per month — feeds into their advanced analytics tools, helping users optimize their content strategy.

On the account management side, OAuth 2.0 and real-time verification ensure seamless multi-account support, with robust rate limit handling and token refresh mechanisms.

It’s exciting, as Typefully is a small team of just 5 people, to empower creators and companies via the X API to publish more than 130,000 posts every month.
