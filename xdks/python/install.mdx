The XDK Python SDK is available directly from the GitHub repository and can be installed via `pip`.
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- `pip` and `venv` for virtual environments (recommended).
## Quick Install
Install the XDK from the GitHub subdirectory:
```bash
pip install xdk
```
This fetches the latest generated version from the `main` branch.
## Development Install
For development or contributing:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xdevplatform/xdk.git
   cd xdk/python
   ```
2. Install dependencies in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
   This installs the SDK and its runtime dependencies.
3. (Optional) Install dev dependencies for testing/linting:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```
## Verification
Test the installation:
```python
import xdk
print(xdk.__version__)  # Should print the XDK version
```
**Note:** Since the XDK is generated using the OpenAPI spec, always check the [X API changelog](https://docs.x.com/changelog) and XDK release notes in the repo for any changes.
