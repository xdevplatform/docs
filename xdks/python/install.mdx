The XDK Python SDK is available directly from the GitHub repository and can be installed via `pip`.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- `pip` and `venv` for virtual environments (recommended).

## Quick Install
Install the XDK from the GitHub subdirectory:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/xdevplatform/xdk.git@main#subdirectory=xdk/python"
```

This fetches the latest generated version from the `main` branch.

## Development Install
For development or contributing:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xdevplatform/xdk.git
   cd xdk/python
   ```

2. Install dependencies in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   This installs the SDK and its runtime dependencies.

3. (Optional) Install dev dependencies for testing/linting:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

## Verification
Test the installation:

```python
import xdk
print(xdk.__version__)  # Should print the XDK version
```

**Note:** Since the XDK is generated using the OpenAPI spec, always check the [X API changelog](https://docs.x.com/changelog) and XDK release notes in the repo for any changes.
