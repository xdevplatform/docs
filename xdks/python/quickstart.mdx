This example showcases how to quickly search for Posts using the XDK using Bearer Token authentication.

## Step 1: Install the SDK
```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/xdevplatform/xdk.git@main#subdirectory=xdk/python"
```

## Step 2: Get Your Bearer Token
1. Log in to the [X Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard).
2. Create or select an app.
3. Under "Keys and Tokens," generate a Bearer Token (app-only auth).

## Step 3: Write and Run Your First Script
Create a file `quickstart.py`:

```python
# Import the client
from xdk import Client

# Replace with your actual Bearer Token
client = Client(bearer_token="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE")

# Fetch recent Posts mentioning "api"
response = client.tweets.get_recent(query="api", max_results=5)

# Print the first Post's text
if response.data:
    print(f"Latest Post: {response.data[0].text}")
else:
    print("No Posts found.")
```

Run it:
```bash
python quickstart.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Latest Post: Exciting updates on XDK Python SDK!
```

**Troubleshooting**: If you get a 401 error, double-check your Bearer Token. For rate limits (429), wait and retry.
