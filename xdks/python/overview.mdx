The Python XDK (X Developer Kit) is our official client library for interacting with the X API v2 using Python. It allows developers to get started with our API quickly and build applications with it. It is generated based on our official [OpenAPI specification](https://api.x.com/2/openapi.json). It abstracts away low-level HTTP details while providing fine-grained control when needed.

## Key Features
- 🔐 **OAuth Support**: Full support for Bearer Token (app-only) auth, OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (user context), and OAuth 1.0.
- 🔄 **Pagination**: Automatically page through large results. The XDK takes care of pagination without requiring you to make multiple API calls using the `next_token`.
- 📡 **Streaming**: Supports real-time data streaming for endpoints like filtered stream that require persistent http connection.
- 🎯 **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports all X API v2 endpoints including such as search, timelines, filtered-stream and more.

**Version Compatibility**: Python 3.8+. Tested on CPython and PyPy.
