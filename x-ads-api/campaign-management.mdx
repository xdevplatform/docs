## Advertiser API

Programatically schedule campaigns and manage ads on X through this suite of APIs.

## What Can You Promote?

### [Promoted Ads](https://business.twitter.com/help/what-are-promoted-tweets)

- Promoted Ads are ordinary ads purchased by advertisers who want to reach a wider group of users or to spark engagement from their existing followers.
- Promoted Ads are clearly labeled as Promoted when an advertiser is paying for their placement on X. In every other respect, Promoted Ads act just like regular ads and can be reposted, replied to, liked and more. They have typical delivery rules and are created using [POST statuses/update](/x-api/posts/creation-of-a-post).
- **“Promoted-only” Tweets,** created via [POST accounts/:account_id/tweet](/x-ads-api/creatives#post-accounts-account-id-tweet), can be used in Promoted Tweets campaigns but will not serve to followers or appear on the public timeline. To retrieve a list of promoted-only tweets for a certain account, use [GET accounts/:account_id/scoped_timeline](/x-ads-api/creatives).

### [Promoted Accounts](https://business.twitter.com/help/what-are-promoted-accounts)

- Promoted Accounts are part of Who to Follow, which suggests accounts that people don’t currently follow and may find interesting. Promoted Accounts help introduce an even wider variety of accounts people may enjoy.
- Promoted Accounts for Timeline, associate a Promoted Tweet with a Promoted Account campaign and will display in user timelines.

Promoted Trends are not available in the Ads API.

## Campaigns and Ad Groups (Line Items)

Campaigns define the schedule and budget of an ad. The advertiser specifies a daily and overall budget. The campaign can be bound to a specific start and end time or run continuously until the budget is spent. The budget comes from one of the Funding Instruments of the advertising account. Campaign identifiers (:campaign_id) are the base-36 representation of the base-10 value we present in the X Ads UI.

Advertising accounts are limited to a maximum of 200 active campaigns. This limit can be raised to 4,000 active campaigns manually by the advertiser’s X Account Manager upon request. A campaign is considered active until it reaches its end time or gets deleted. Paused campaigns are considered active until their designated end times.

Line items spend the budget defined by a campaign. Line items pull together the per-engagement bid, the Tweet or account to promote, and the targeting rules.

## Analytics

The X Ads API offers a set of analytics endpoints to track and optimize ad performance. Please see Analytics and Analytics Best Practices for more information.

For the billing metric, the data may not be finalized until three days after the event. Before that point, the data should be considered speculative. The final billable number will always be less than the speculative amount. The billable number is corrected for spam and related low-quality traffic. See Timezones for other considerations regarding time.

## Creating a Campaign - Step-by-Step

The following example assumes you have installed, configured, and authorized your app and user using [twurl](https://github.com/twitter/twurl). twurl is a command-line tool in the spirit of cURL that gracefully handles X OAuth authentication. twurl is a great tool for quickly testing and debugging Ads API (and REST API) functionality. To see the full headers of the request and response, use `-t` to trace the call, roughly equivalent to cURL’s `-v` option.

**For this example, we will create a Promoted Ads campaign that will be targeted by keyword.**

1. **Retrieve the account id.**

```
twurl -H ads-api.x.com /9/accounts/
```

```JSON
{
  "request": {
    "params": {
    }
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Test account for @AdsAPI",
      "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
      "timezone_switch_at": null,
      "id": "xxxxxx",
      "created_at": "2014-03-09T00:41:49Z",
      "salt": "f9f9d5a5f23075c618da5eb1d1a9df57",
      "updated_at": "2015-01-29T00:41:49Z",
      "approval_status": "ACCEPTED",
      "deleted": false
    }
  ],
  "data_type": "account",
  "total_count": 1,
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

2. **Retrieve the funding instrument id.**

Hit the [GET accounts/:account_id/funding_instruments](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-funding-instruments) API using the account id retrieved in the previous command.
```
twurl -H ads-api.x.com /9/accounts/xxxxxx/funding_instruments
```

```JSON
{
  "data": [
    {
      "cancelled": true,
      "created_at": "2014-03-09T00:41:49Z",
      "credit_limit_local_micro": null,
      "currency": "USD",
      "deleted": false,
      "description": null,
      "end_time": null,
      "funded_amount_local_micro": null,
      "id": "yyyy",
      "type": null,
      "updated_at": "2014-05-29T00:41:49Z"
    }
  ],
  "data_type": "funding_instrument",
  "next_cursor": null,
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "account_id": "xxxxxx"
    }
  },
  "total_count": 1
}
```

3. **Create a campaign and associate it with the funding instrument.**

Specify a start time and a budget for the campaign. For the purpose of this example, we will use a budget of \$500 and for the daily limit, \$50.

```
twurl -H ads-api.x.com -d "funding_instrument_id=yyyy&name=My First Campaign&total_budget_amount_local_micro=500000000&daily_budget_amount_local_micro=50000000" /9/accounts/xxxxxx/campaigns
```

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "created_at": "2015-02-09T00:00:00Z",
    "currency": "USD",
    "daily_budget_amount_local_micro": 50000000,
    "deleted": false,
    "end_time": null,
    "funding_instrument_id": "yyyy",
    "id": "92ph",
    "name": "My First Campaign",
    "entity_status": "PAUSED",
    "standard_delivery": true,
    "total_budget_amount_local_micro": 500000000,
    "updated_at": "2015-02-09T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "data_type": "campaign",
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "account_id": "xxxxxx",
      "daily_budget_amount_local_micro": 50000000,
      "funding_instrument_id": "yyyy",
      "name": "My First Campaign",
      "total_budget_amount_local_micro": 500000000
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Create a line item associated with the campaign.**

Now that we have a campaign id, we can create a line item to associate with it. The line item wraps the bid price, targeting, and actual creative portion of the campaign. For this line item, we will be promoting tweets with a bid of $1.50.

```
twurl -H ads-api.x.com -d "campaign_id=XXXX&bid_amount_local_micro=1500000&product_type=PROMOTED_TWEETS&placements=ALL_ON_TWITTER&objective=ENGAGEMENTS&entity_status=PAUSED" /9/accounts/xxxxxxx/line_items
```

```JSON
{
  "data_type": "line_item",
  "data": {
    "bid_type": "MAX",
    "name": "Untitled",
    "placements": [
      "ALL_ON_TWITTER"
    ],
    "bid_amount_local_micro": 1500000,
    "automatically_select_bid": false,
    "advertiser_domain": null,
    "primary_web_event_tag": null,
    "charge_by": "ENGAGEMENT",
    "product_type": "PROMOTED_TWEETS",
    "bid_unit": "ENGAGEMENT",
    "total_budget_amount_local_micro": null,
    "objective": "ENGAGEMENTS",
    "id": "azjx",
    "entity_status": "PAUSED",
    "optimization": "DEFAULT",
    "categories": [],
    "currency": "USD",
    "created_at": "2015-02-09T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-02-09T00:00:00Z",
    "include_sentiment": "POSITIVE_ONLY",
    "campaign_id": "92ph",
    "deleted": false
  },
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "placements": [
        "ALL_ON_TWITTER"
      ],
      "bid_amount_local_micro": 1500000,
      "product_type": "PROMOTED_TWEETS",
      "entity_status": "PAUSED",
      "account_id": "xxxxxxx",
      "campaign_id": "92ph"
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Create a targeting profile associated with the line item.**

With the line item created, we can assign targeting criteria. We want to target the phrase keywords “grumpy cat” in the San Francisco Bay Area location. This is going to require a location id lookup and two targeting_criteria POST requests.

```
twurl -H ads-api.x.com "/9/targeting_criteria/locations?location_type=CITIES&q=San Francisco"
```

```JSON
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose CA, US",
      "targeting_type": "LOCATION",
      "targeting_value": "5122804691e5fecc"
    }
  ],
  "data_type": "targeting_criterion",
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "location_type": "CITY",
      "q": "San Francisco"
    }
  }
}
```

```
twurl -H ads-api.x.com -X POST -d "line_item_id=yyyy&targeting_type=LOCATION&targeting_value=5122804691e5fecc" /9/accounts/xxxxxx/targeting_criteria
```

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "created_at": "2015-02-09T00:00:15Z",
    "deleted": false,
    "id": "2u3be",
    "line_item_id": "yyyy",
    "name": "San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose CA, US",
    "targeting_type": "LOCATION",
    "targeting_value": "5122804691e5fecc",
    "updated_at": "2013-05-30T21:01:35Z"
  },
  "data_type": "targeting_criterion",
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "account_id": "xxxxxx",
      "line_item_id": "yyyy",
      "targeting_type": "LOCATION",
      "targeting_value": "5122804691e5fecc"
    }
  }
}
```

```
twurl -H ads-api.x.com -X POST -d "line_item_id=yyyy&targeting_type=PHRASE_KEYWORD&targeting_value=grumpy cat" /9/accounts/xxxxxx/targeting_criteria
```

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "created_at": "2015-02-09T00:00:20Z",
    "deleted": false,
    "id": "2u3bd",
    "line_item_id": "yyyy",
    "name": "grumpy cat",
    "targeting_type": "PHRASE_KEYWORD",
    "targeting_value": "grumpy cat",
    "updated_at": "2013-05-30T18:05:35Z"
  },
  "data_type": "targeting_criterion",
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "account_id": "xxxxxx",
      "line_item_id": "yyyy",
      "targeting_type": "PHRASE_KEYWORD",
      "targeting_value": "grumpy cat"
    }
  }
}
```

6. **Finally, un-pause the line item.**

```
twurl -H ads-api.x.com -X PUT "/9/accounts/xxxxxx/line_items/yyyy/?entity_status=ACTIVE"
```

```JSON
{
  "data_type": "line_item",
  "data": {
    "bid_type": "MAX",
    "name": "grumpy cat",
    "placements": [],
    "bid_amount_local_micro": 1500000,
    "automatically_select_bid": false,
    "advertiser_domain": null,
    "primary_web_event_tag": null,
    "charge_by": "ENGAGEMENT",
    "product_type": "PROMOTED_TWEETS",
    "bid_unit": "ENGAGEMENT",
    "total_budget_amount_local_micro": null,
    "objective": "ENGAGEMENTS",
    "id": "yyyy",
    "entity_status": "ACTIVE",
    "optimization": "DEFAULT",
    "categories": [],
    "currency": "USD",
    "created_at": "2015-02-09T00:00:20Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-02-09T00:00:20Z",
    "include_sentiment": "POSITIVE_ONLY",
    "campaign_id": "dy1f",
    "deleted": false
  },
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "line_item_id": "yyyy",
      "entity_status": "ACTIVE",
      "account_id": "xxxxxx"
    }
  }
}
```

That’s it! We now have an active, targeted, and funded Promoted Tweets in Timelines campaign which is running.

### Objective Based Campaigns

Objective-based campaigns and pricing allow advertisers to pay for the actions that are aligned with their marketing objectives. To support these, set the appropriate `objective` on line items.

The parameter used on the line item write endpoints and returned on the read endpoints, is `objective`. This field has the following possible values as of today:

* `APP_ENGAGEMENTS`
* `APP_INSTALLS`
* `FOLLOWERS`
* `ENGAGEMENTS`
* `REACH`
* `VIDEO_VIEWS`
* `PREROLL_VIEWS`
* `WEBSITE_CLICKS`

Objectives impact how we optimize campaigns in our auctions and how we bill on those campaigns. We enable pricing based on objective, such as CPAC for `APP_ENGAGEMENTS`, CPAC _or_ CPI for `APP_INSTALLS`, CPLC for `WEBSITE_CLICKS`, CPF for `FOLLOWERS`, CPE for `ENGAGEMENTS`, and CPM for `REACH`.

Mobile app promotion campaigns are required to contain either the `APP_ENGAGEMENTS` or `APP_INSTALLS` objective.

**Note:** Line items with different objectives are not allowed under the same campaign.

| Campaign objective  | API objective  | Media in Tweets  | Pricing model  |
|:---------------------|:----------------|:------------------|:----------------|
| App re-engagements  | `APP_ENGAGEMENTS` | Image or video app download card required. | CPAC           |
| App installs        | `APP_INSTALLS` | Image or video app download card required. | CPAC or CPI (set using `charge_by`) |
| Reach               | `REACH`         | No restrictions. | CPM            |
| Followers           | `FOLLOWERS`     | Tweet not required, but recommended. There are no media restrictions on Tweets for Followers campaigns, though we recommend text-only Tweets. [More information](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-setup/create-a-followers-campaign.html#serve) | CPF            |
| Engagements         | `ENGAGEMENTS`   | No restrictions. | CPE            |
| Video Views         | `VIDEO_VIEWS`   | Video conversation card, video, or GIF required. | CPV or cost per 3s/100% view |
| Pre-roll views      | `PREROLL_VIEWS` | Video required.  | CPV or cost per 3s/100% view |
| Website Clicks      | `WEBSITE_CLICKS`| Website card recommended, but not required. Tweet must have either a website card or a website link (not both). | CPLC           |

### Funding Instruments

Funding Instruments are the source of campaign budget. Funding Instruments can not be created via the Ads API, they have to be already established by the advertiser’s account manager at Twitter (for credit lines) or via ads.twitter.com (for credit cards) to be available.

To get a list of all `funding_instruments` on an account, see [GET accounts/:account\_id/funding\_instruments](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-funding-instruments) and [GET accounts/:account\_id/funding\_instruments/:funding\_instrument\_id](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-funding-instruments-funding-instrument-id) for the details of a specific one.

#### Funding Instrument Attributes

Descriptive: `account_id`, funding instrument `id`, funding instrument `type`, `description`, and `io_header`(insertion order header ID). Note that a single `io_header` may be associated with multiple funding instruments.

Funding ability: `able_to_fund` and `reasons_not_able_to_fund`.

Time: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `start_time`, and `end_time` represented by a string, formatted as “%Y-%m-%dT%l:%M:%S%z”.

Boolean status: `paused`, `deleted`, and `cancelled` (true or false).

Financial: `currency` ([ISO-4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) format), `credit_limit_local_micro`, `credit_remaining_local_micro`, and `funded_amount_local_micro`. The value of a currency is represented in micros. For USD, $5.50 is encoded as 5.50*1e6, or 5,500,000. To represent a “whole value”, you need to multiply the local micro by 1e6 (1\_000\_000) for all currencies.

#### Attribute Details

`credit_limit_local_micro` is only valid for `CREDIT_CARD` or `CREDIT_LINE` type funding instruments and represents the credit limit for that instrument.

`funded_amount_local_micro` is only valid for `INSERTION_ORDER` type funding instruments and represents the allocated budget.

`credit_remaining_local_micro` is valid for `CREDIT_LINE` and `AGENCY_CREDIT_LINE` type funding instruments. It represents the `credit_limit_local_micro` minus the amount already spent on that funding instrument. It does not represent the difference between `funded_amount_local_micro` and the amount spent. We draw a distinction between credit limit and funded amount because they represent different underlying funding methods and spending agreements we have with advertisers.

#### Types of Funding Instruments

**Credit Cards**

Typically used by self-serve advertisers (without an account manager).

**Credit Lines**

These are in the form of insertion orders (IOs) and are set by account managers.

**Multi-Handle Credit Lines**

Advertisers can fund campaigns across multiple handles with this type of credit line. This feature is enabled by their Twitter Account Manager, associating the different @handles to a specific credit line.

For example, @NikeSB and @NikeFuel can both have access to the @Nike credit line. This funding instrument is available just like any other. You retrieve the data by submitting a GET request to the funding_instrument endpoint. Here is a sample response (note the `CREDIT_LINE` type).

      ```json
      GET https://ads-api.x.com/5/accounts/a0b1c3/funding_instruments

{
    "request": {
        "params": {
            "account_id": "a0b1c3"
        }
    },
    "data": [
        {
            "start_time": "2013-05-30T04:00:00Z",
            "description": "FakeNike - Credit Line",
            "credit_limit_local_micro": 150000000000,
            "end_time": null,
            "cancelled": false,
            "id": "i1234",
            "paused": false,
            "account_id": "a0b1c3",
            "reasons_not_able_to_fund": [],
            "io_header": null,
            "currency": "USD",
            "funded_amount_local_micro": 0,
            "created_at": "2013-05-30T18:16:38Z",
            "type": "CREDIT_LINE",
            "able_to_fund": true,
            "updated_at": "2013-05-30T18:16:38Z",
            "credit_remaining_local_micro": 123661919751,
            "deleted": false,
        }
    ],
    "data_type": "funding_instrument",
    "total_count": 1,
    "next_cursor": null
}
```


The only thing particular about this funding instrument is the type and the fact that it is available to all the accounts that were associated to it. Of course, the remaining credit is impacted by all campaigns funded by this instrument, across all accounts sharing it. The details of what accounts are associated to a specific credit line are not available via the API (nor via ads.twitter.com).

### Targeting

Targeting is a core concept of the Ads API. Targeting is set at the line item level and options vary across placements. To set new targeting criteria you need to use [POST accounts/:account\_id/targeting\_criteria](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#post-accounts-account-id-targeting-criteria) and [PUT accounts/:account\_id/targeting\_criteria](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-targeting-criteria) to update them.

Use [GET accounts/:account\_id/line\_items](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-line-items) for a list of all line items and [GET  accounts/:account\_id/line\_items/:line\_item\_id](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-line-items-line-item-id) to retrieve a specific line item.

#### Targeting options by placement


[Promoted Tweets](https://business.twitter.com/help/what-are-promoted-tweets) and [Promoted Accounts](https://business.twitter.com/help/what-are-promoted-accounts) products can be made available on a variety of placements. [Promoted Trends (PTr)](https://business.twitter.com/help/what-are-promoted-trends) are not available via the API.

For possible placement combinations, refer to the [GET line_items/placements](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-line-items-placements) endpoint. Each placement has different options for targeting. Location, Platform and Gender are available for all. The other options are contextual to the type of placement.

* **Twitter Search**: Age Targeting, Devices, Events, Gender, Keyword Types (All), Language, Locations, Network Activation, Network Operators, Platform, Platform Version, Tailored Audiences, WiFi Only
* **Twitter Timeline**: Age Targeting, Devices, Events, Followers Of, Similar to Followers Of, Gender, Interest, Language, Locations, Network Activation, Network Operators, Non-exact Keyword Types, Partner Audience Types, Platform, Platform Version, Retargeting Types, Tailored Audiences, TV Targeting Types, WiFi Only
* **Twitter Profiles & Tweet Details**: Age Targeting, Devices, Events, Followers Of, Similar to Followers Of, Gender, Interest, Language, Locations, Network Activation, Network Operators, Non-exact Keyword Types, Partner Audience Types, Platform, Platform Version, Retargeting Types, Tailored Audiences, TV Targeting Types, WiFi Only

#### Understanding targeting types

**Age Targeting**: Target users based on specific age buckets. A list of age bucket enums can be found on the [Enumerations](/x-ads-api/introduction) page.

[Events](https://business.twitter.com/help/event-targeting): Specify an event for targeting. Only one event can be used for targeting (per line item). Use the [GET targeting_criteria/events](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-events) endpoint to find events available for targeting.

[Gender](https://business.twitter.com/help/geo-gender-and-language-targeting): Target males (1) or females (2). Leave null to target all.

[Installed App Store Categories](https://business.twitter.com/help/installed-app-category-targeting): use this targeting type to target users based on the categories of apps they have installed or have indicated interest in. See [GET targeting\_criteria/app\_store_categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-app-store-categories).

[Interests](https://business.twitter.com/help/interest-and-username-targeting): Target users by interest. Get the interests list from [GET targeting_criteria/interests](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-interests). You can target up to 100 interests.

**Followers Of**: Target the followers of any fully promotable users for the current account (note, currently the primary account holder is the only fully-promotable user of that account). [GET accounts/:account\_id/promotable\_users](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-promotable-users) to get a list of promotable users.

[Similar to Followers Of](https://business.twitter.com/help/interest-and-username-targeting): Target people with the same interests as followers of specific users. You can use up to 100 [Users](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#user).

[Locations](https://business.twitter.com/help/geo-gender-and-language-targeting): Specify up to 2,000 locations to target. Get list from [GET targeting_criteria/locations](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-locations). There are additional requirements for ads that target certain countries. See [Country Targeting and Display Requirements](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#country-targeting-and-display-requirements) for more information.

[Keywords](https://business.twitter.com/help/keyword-targeting): Keyword targeting options are specific by type of placement. You can use up to 1000 keywords for targeting (per line item). See the Keyword Types section for options.

[Language Targeting](https://business.twitter.com/help/geo-gender-and-language-targeting): Target users who understand specific languages.

[Mobile Network Operator Targeting](https://business.twitter.com/help/device-carrier-and-new-mobile-user-targeting): Enables advertisers to target users based on mobile carrier, using the targeting type `NETWORK_OPERATOR` from [GET targeting\_criteria/network\_operators](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-network-operators).

[New Mobile Device Targeting](https://business.twitter.com/help/device-carrier-and-new-mobile-user-targeting): Reach users based on the date that they first accessed Twitter via their device, using the targeting type `NETWORK_ACTIVATION_DURATION` using operator_type of LT for less than and  `GTE` for greater than or equal.

[Platforms](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-platforms), [Platform Versions](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-platform-versions), [Devices](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-devices), and Wifi-Only: Allows targeting of mobile devices across a variety of vectors. Platforms is a high-level targeting type that can hit broad categories of phone. Example values are `iOS` and `Android`. Devices allow you to target users of specific mobile devices, for example the `iPhone 5s`, `Nexus 4`, or `Samsung Galaxy Note`. Platform versions allow you to target users of versions of specific mobile operating systems, down to the point release. Examples include iOS 7.1 and Android 4.4. Wifi-Only allows you to target only those users who are using their devices on a WiFi network; if this is not set, users using the carrier connection as well as WiFi will be targeted.

* Users can target platforms and devices if there is no overlap. I can target Blackberry as a platform and iPad Air as a device simultaneously.
* Users can target devices and os versions simultaneously. I can target iPad Air and iOS >= 7.0.
* Users cannot target platforms that are broader than devices. I cannot target iOS and iPad Air.

[Tailored Audiences]/x-ads-api/audiences: Reach users through an approved ads partner to target groups of customers and connect with them on Twitter.

**[TV Targeting](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170766-tv-targeting)**


**TV Show Targeting**: reach people that engage with specific TV programs. This targeting criteria can be configured to continuously target while a campaign is active with the `TV_SHOW` targeting type. Use the [GET targeting\_criteria/tv\_markets](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-tv-markets) and [GET targeting\_criteria/tv\_shows](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-targeting-criteria-tv-shows) endpoints to determine TV shows available.

**Tweet Engager Retargeting**

Tweet engager retargeting enables advertisers to target audiences across devices who have previously been exposed to or engaged with their promoted or organic Tweets on Twitter. With this targeting advertisers can follow up with people who saw or engaged with an advertiser’s content on Twitter and are most likely to further engage or convert with subsequent messaging or offers. Users will be eligible for targeting within minutes of exposure or engagement and will remain eligible for up to 90 days afterwards for engagements and 30 days for exposures.

Tweet Engager Targeting Types:

* `ENGAGEMENT_TYPE` which accepts either `IMPRESSION` or `ENGAGEMENT` as a targeting value. This specifies whether you wish to target exposed users (`IMPRESSION`) or engaged users (`ENGAGEMENT`).
* `CAMPAIGN_ENGAGEMENT` uses a campaign ID as the targeting value. Users who engaged with or were exposed to this campaign (depending on `ENGAGEMENT_TYPE`) are the ones who will be targeted.
* `USER_ENGAGEMENT` which uses the promoted user ID as the targeting value to target users who were exposed to or engaged with an advertiser’s organic content (depending on `ENGAGEMENT_TYPE`). This must be the promoted user ID associated with the Ads account.

_Note:_ `ENGAGEMENT_TYPE` is required in addition to at least one valid `CAMPAIGN_ENGAGEMENT` or `USER_ENGAGEMENT` value. Both tweet engager targeting types may be present and multiple campaigns may be targeted on a given line item.

**Video Viewer Targeting**: Video viewer targeting builds on Tweet engager targeting to enable advertisers to target audiences who have previously watched part or all of a video on Twitter. Advertisers can target organic videos, promoted videos, or both. Promoted videos are not limited to video view objective campaigns or line items.

Video Viewer Targeting Types:

* `VIDEO_VIEW` for users who have clicked to play the video or have viewed 3 seconds of autoplay
* `VIDEO_VIEW_PARTIAL` for users who have viewed 50% of the video
* `VIDEO_VIEW_COMPLETE` for users who have viewed at least 95% of the video

As with Tweet engager targeting, one or both of the following must also be present in targeting criteria for the line item when `ENGAGEMENT_TYPE` is used:

* `CAMPAIGN_ENGAGEMENT` uses a campaign ID as the targeting value. Users who watched a video (based on `ENGAGEMENT_TYPE`) in this campaign are the ones who will be targeted.
* `USER_ENGAGEMENT` which uses the promoted user ID as the targeting value to target users who watched a video (based on `ENGAGEMENT_TYPE`) in an advertiser’s organic content. This must be the promoted user ID associated with the Ads account.

**Keyword Types**

See our support document on [keyword targeting](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-setup/campaign-targeting/keyword-targeting.html) for a conceptual overview.

* **Broad** (default value): match all words, independent of order. Not sensitive to capitalization, plurals or tense. Will automatically be expanded when possible (i.e. “car repair” would also match “automobile fix”). If you want to target without expansion, you need to add a + sign before the keywords, like “+boat +jet”. Using keywords without the + will default to Broad Match.
* **Unordered** (deprecated): match all words, independent of order. Not sensitive to capitalization, plurals or tense.
* **Phrase**: match the exact keywords string, other keywords can be present.
* **Exact**: match exactly the keywords string, not any others.
* **Negative**: avoid matching searches that include all of these keywords somewhere in the query, regardless of the order in which they are written, even if other words are present.
* **Negative Phrase**: avoid matching searches that include this exact keywords string somewhere in the query, even if other words are present.
* **Negative Exact**: avoid matching searches that exactly match these keywords and contain no other words.
     

**Emoji targeting**

Emoji targeting is supported via keyword targeting. To use emoji targeting, simply create keyword targeting for Unicode codepoints representing that emoji such as _U+1F602_ (_xF0x9Fx98x82_ in UTF-8) for the ‘face with tears of joy’ emoji (&#x1f602;). Emoji which we accept can be confirmed with the [twemoji](https://twitter.github.io/twemoji/preview.html) list. Targeting an emoji targets all variations.

For a summary of all values with required/optional and specific details for each, see [PUT accounts/:account\_id/targeting\_criteria](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-targeting-criteria).

#### Targeting Criteria Combinations


**Updated Campaign Workflow**

Create campaigns which target broadly with geo, gender, language, and device/platform criteria. Advertisers can then combine the broad targeting with additional targeting criteria (e.g. interests, keywords, followers, tailored audiences, TV). **If no targeting criteria is specified for a line item, the line item will target all users worldwide.**

|     |     |
| :--- | :--- |
| “Primary” Types | Other Types |
| Followers | Locations |
| Tailored Audiences | Gender |
| Interests | Languages |
| Keywords | Devices and platforms |
| TV  | Age |

Targeting criteria will be combined for your ad group such that:

* “Primary” Targeting Types will get **∪**‘d (i.e. put in a logical union).
* Other Targeting Types will get **AND**‘d.
* Same types will get **OR**‘d.

**Some examples**

At a glance: \[(**Followers**) ∪ (**Tailored Audiences**) ∪ (**Interests**) ∪ (**Keywords**)\] AND (**Location**) AND (**Gender**) AND (**Languages**) AND (**Devices and Platforms**)

A Geo example:

Let’s say we want an ad group for our campaign to serve targeting:

* Twitter users in the U.S., England, and Canada (Location)
* who are Women (Gender)
* derived from Tailored Audiences list (“Primary”)
* with Keywords (“Primary”)

The targeting criteria will be:

\[**US** OR **GB** OR **CA**\] AND \[**Female**\] AND \[**Tailored Audiences** ∪ **Keyword**\]

### Additional examples

* Select Gender and Geo but no primary: (**Male**) AND (**US** OR **GB**)
* Select Gender, Geo, Interest: (**Female**) AND (**CA**) AND (**Computers** OR **Technology** OR **Startups**)
* Select Gender, Geo, Interest, Tailored Audiences, Keywords: (**Male**) AND (**GB**) AND (**Cars** ∪ **Tailored Audiences for CRM** ∪ **autocross**)

### Budget Pacing

Advertisers now have more control over how fast their daily budgets are spent on your Promoted Tweet and Account campaigns. Enabling standard delivery, which is the default, ensures an even spend rate throughout the day.

By turning **off** standard delivery, we will serve impressions and generate engagements as quickly as possible until your daily budget is exhausted, which may be quite early on in the day depending on targeting and competition. This is called accelerated delivery.

**Getting Started**

Standard delivery is the default option for all campaigns, so no action is required unless you wish to turn it off. To spend through your daily budget on a campaign as fast as possible set the `standard_delivery` parameter to `false` to set the pace to accelerated delivery (see [GET accounts/:account_id/campaigns](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-campaigns)).

**Notes**

* “Day” is respective to Twitter [advertiser account](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#accounts) timezone (eg. America/Los_Angeles).
* Early results indicate that standard delivery will improve eCPE/CPF for advertisers, with more consistent coverage throughout the day.

For more additional information about budgets and pacing please see the [Bidding and Auctions FAQ](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/troubleshooting/bidding-and-auctions-faqs.html).
### Target Bidding
Campaign management

#### Bid Strategy

We have introduced the concept of Bid Strategy to simplify campaign creation workflow and reduce confusion about combinations of multiple parameters.

All previous (marked as legacy) combinations of parameters can be achieved by setting an equivalent goal parameter. Further information can be found in the announcement [here](https://twittercommunity.com/t/ads-api-version-10/158787/1#changed-default-bid_strategy-values-9).

As example:

|     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Campaign Objective** | **Legacy** | **Ads API v10+** |
| App Installs | `bid_type`= `AUTO`<br/><br/>`bid_unit` = `APP_INSTALLS`<br/><br/>`charge_by` = `APP_CLICKS` | `goal` = `APP_INSTALLS`<br/><br/>`bid_strategy` = `AUTO` |
| Website Clicks | `bid_type` = `TARGET` (Note: `bid_unit` was not needed for some campaign objectives) | `bid_strategy` = `TARGET` |

#### Target Bidding


Using target bidding, you can specify a target cost you want to pay and the Twitter Ads platform will optimize your campaign for performance while staying near or below your target cost.

This feature gives you the flexibility to reach users who are especially likely to take the desired action (such as a link click, a lead or a follow) while maintaining cost control. This is a powerful feature for advertisers who desire more options for campaign setup and optimization (including bidding options).

For line items with compatible campaign objectives, we’ve introduced a new pricing mechanism for bid amount that lets you specify a target cost you want to pay. Our ad platform dynamically bids on your behalf to help you drive more results, while working to keep your average cost within 20% of your specified target. The `bid_strategy` setting on line items may be set with a value of `TARGET` to enable target bidding on relevant campaign objectives, such as:

* `WEBSITE_CLICKS`
* `WEBSITE_CONVERSIONS` 
* `APP_INSTALLS` 
* `APP_ENGAGEMENTS`
* `REACH`

### Country Targeting and Display Requirements
Campaign management

Country-specific targeting and display requirements are contained on this page. These requirements must be adhered to by all partners.

#### Russia

[Twitter’s Ads Policies](https://support.twitter.com/groups/58-advertising/topics/249-advertiser-policies/articles/20171727-illegal-products-and-services) prohibit advertisers from targeting Russia with advertisements that are not in the Russian language. When your users specifically target Russia, you must display the following warning message to your users:

Ads targeting Russia must be in the Russian language.

### Partner Managed Funding Instruments

The onboarding flow configures an [ads.twitter.com](https://ads.twitter.com) account for the Twitter account, which can be managed by the partner through the Ads API, and whose advertising spend is billed to the partner.
 

#### Partner Initial Set-up

The process to initially set-up a new PMFI Ads API partner takes up to 3-weeks from exchange of required information. The following must be shared with your technical contacts at Twitter, as well as the Twitter contact managing the integration with the partner in order to get the process started:

* **The partner must share their PGP/GPG public key.** A shared secret key needs to be exchanged between the Ads API partner and Twitter. This will be used to verify data during the onboarding flow.
* **The** `app_id` **or** `consumer_secret` **for the [Twitter app](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that will be used for Ads API access.** You can view and edit your existing Twitter apps via the [app dashboard](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/apps) if you are logged into your Twitter account on developer.twitter.com. If you need to create a Twitter app, you will need to have an approved [developer account](/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal). Twitter allows one app for production+sandbox and one optional app for sandbox-only access. The Twitter app must be created on a corporate, partner-controlled Twitter handle.
     

#### Advertiser Onboarding Flow

The advertiser onboarding flow occurs via a web browser in the following way:

1.  The user starts the onboarding flow on the partner’s website and enters the handle they want to onboard.
2.  The partner redirects the user to a URL on [ads.twitter.com](https://ads.twitter.com) with a signed payload. This payload contains the partner’s API `app_id`, the Twitter `user_id` of the Twitter handle which is to be onboarded and a callback URL and other fields documented below.
3.  The user is asked to sign into [ads.twitter.com](http://ads.twitter.com) using the standard twitter.com login page.
4.  Once the user is logged in, the onboarding process is initiated. This step includes ad review, account validation and other checks.
5.  When all onboarding tasks are completed, the user is redirected to the callback URL that was provided by the Ads API partner, with a payload that indicates success or failure. This includes the 3-legged authorization process.
     

#### Onboarding redirect payload

URL for redirect:

https://ads.twitter.com/link\_managed\_account

The redirect URL will be called with the following parameters:

|     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| callback_url | URL encoded string | user will be redirected to this url after the account link process completes, regardless of outcome. See the partner redirect url section for protocol details |
| client\_app\_id | integer | X API client app id, used to identify the managing partner |
| promotable\_user\_id | integer | Twitter user_id of the @handle whose promotions are to be managed by the managing partner. Used to make sure it is the same as the user who logs into ads.twitter.com to complete the linking process |
| fi_description | URL encoded String (max 255 characters) | funding instrument name. This will be displayed in the description field in the API when the funding instrument is retrieved. If a funding\_instrument description is given, the existing funding\_instrument will be paused, and a new managed partner funding instrument will be set up. (if one exists with the same name, nothing will happen) |
| timezone | String, in Area/Location format | This will be the timezone used to determine the day to which daily budgets apply, and in which charges will be aggregated |
| currency | ISO 4217 Currency Code | Currency that will be used to enter bids, and in which charges will be billed |
| country | ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 Country Code | Billing Country for the account |
| signature | URL encoded, base64 encoded binary code, as explained below | signature that combines a shared secret and the other parameters to verify authenticity of the call, as well as validity of the parameters. |

#### Callback URL payload

The base redirect URL is provided using the callback_url parameter on the account link request (see above). The parameters added by [ads.twitter.com](https://ads.twitter.com) are:

|     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Name | Type | Description |
| status | string | **OK** an account was created, or an existing, eligible account was found.<br/><br/>**ACCOUNT_INELIGIBLE** if partner specific constraints are not met **USER_MISMATCH** the Twitter account used to sign into ads.twitter.com was different from the promotable\_user\_id on the account link request **INCOMPLETE\_SERVING\_BILLING_INFO** timezone, currency or country were not specified **INVALID_COUNTRY** an invalid country value was given **INVALID_CURRENCY** an invalid currency value was given **INVALID_TIMEZONE** an invalid timezone value was given |
| account_id | URL encoded string | Twitter ads account id of the linked account |
| funding\_instrument\_id | URL encoded string | ID of the active partner managed funding instrument |
| signature | URL encoded, base64 encoded binary code, as explained below | Base64 encoded HMAC-SHA1 signature that combines a shared secret and the other parameters to verify authenticity of the call, as well as validity of the parameters. To make sure the callback url is only valid for the Twitter user\_id that the account link process was intended for, the twitter user\_id is to be appended to the shared secret (using &) when signing the request. |

To make sure the callback URL is only valid for the Twitter `user_id` that the account link process was intended for, the Twitter `user_id` is to be appended to the shared secret (using &) when signing the request.
 

#### Signing the request and callback URLs

In order to ensure that the requests to `/link_managed_account` and the callback url are valid, the requests need to be signed at the source and verified by the recipient before the recipient takes action on them. Signing the request with a secret that is shared between Twitter and the managing partner ensures that each party only accepts requests sent by the authorized counterpart.

The signature generation algorithm is similar to the one used in OAuth.

Create a signature base string as follows:

* Convert the HTTP Method to uppercase and set the base string equal to this value.
* Append the ‘&’ character to the base string.
* Percent encode the URL (without parameters) and append it to the base string.
* Append the ‘&’ character to the base string.
* Append the percent encoded query string, which is built as follows:
* Percent encode every key and value that will be signed.
* Sort the list of parameters alphabetically by key.
* For each key/value pair (and with primary\_promotable\_user_id for the partner redirect url):
* Append the percent encoded key to the query string.
* Append the ‘=’ character to the base string.
* Append the percent encoded value to the query string.
* Separate the percent encoded key=value pairs with the ‘&’ character.
* Use the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm, using the previously exchanged shared secret, as the key, and the base string as the value to generate the signature.
* Base64 encode the output of Step 2, drop the trailing newline character percent encode the signature generated in Step 3 and add it to the url in a signature parameter
     

#### Signing examples

Signing a link account request

Url to sign, assuming a GET request:

https://ads.twitter.com/link\_managed\_account?callback\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmanagingpartner.com%2Flink\_account\_callback&amp;client\_app\_id=12345&amp;fi\_description=some%20name&amp;promotable\_user\_id=1

This url has the following parameters:

callback\_url = https://managingpartner.com/link\_account_callback
client\_app\_id = 12345
fi_description = some name
promotable\_user\_id = 1

The base string consisting of http method and url without parameters, steps a - d, looks like:

GET https://ads.twitter.com/link\_managed\_account

The query string, produced by the substeps of e, looks like:

callback\_url=https://managingpartner.com/link\_account\_callback&client\_app\_id=12345&fi\_description=some name&promotable\_user\_id=1

Note that the key-value pairs are sorted by key name.

The percent encoded query string looks like:

callback\_url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmanagingpartner.com%252Flink\_account\_callback%26client\_app\_id%3D12345%26fi\_description%3Dsome%2520name%26promotable\_user\_id%3D1

The complete base string, combining steps a - d and e:

GET https://ads.twitter.com/link\_managed\_account&callback\_url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmanagingpartner.com%252Flink\_account\_callback%26client\_app\_id%3D12345%26fi\_description%3Dsome%2520name%26promotable\_user\_id%3D1

Using the hmac-sha1 algorithm we will sign this with the word “secret” as the key. The result is Base64 encoded, and presented without the final “\\n” (steps 2 and 3): `KBxQMMSpKRrtg9aw3qxK4fTXvUc=`

This signature is then added (percent encoded) to the end of the original url in the signature parameter (step 4):

https://ads.twitter.com/link\_managed\_account?callback\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmanagingpartner.com%2Flink\_account\_callback&amp;client\_app\_id=12345&amp;fi\_description=some%20name&amp;promotable\_user\_id=1&amp;signature=KBxQMMSpKRrtg9aw3qxK4fTXvUc%3D

Signing a partner redirect url (account link request callback) The URL to sign, assuming a GET request:

https://managingpartner.com/link\_account\_callback?status=OK&amp;account\_id=ABC&amp;funding\_instrument_id=DEF

This url has the following parameters:

`account_id` = `ABC`, `funding_instrument_id` = `DEF` and `status` = `OK`

The base string consisting of http method and url without parameters, steps a - d, looks like:

GET https%3A%2F%2Fmanagingpartner.com%2Flink\_account\_callback&``

The query string, produced by the substeps of e, looks like:

account\_id=ABC&funding\_instrument_id=DEF&status=OK

The percent encoded query string looks like:

account\_id%3DABC%26funding\_instrument_id%3DDEF%26status%3DOK

The complete base string, combining steps a - d and e:

GET https%3A%2F%2Fmanagingpartner.com%2Flink\_account\_callback&account\_id%3DABC%26funding\_instrument_id%3DDEF%26status%3DOK

Using the hmac-sha1 algorithm we will sign this with the word “secret” and the twitter user id for which the original link request was made, 1 (`promotable_user_id` = 1 from above) as the key, “secret&1”.

The result is Base64 encoded, and presented without the final “\\n” (steps 2 and 3): `jDSHDkHJIFXpPLVxtA3a9d4bPjM=`

This signature is then added (percent encoded) to the end of the original url in the signature parameter (step 4):

https://managingpartner.com/link\_account\_callback?&amp;status=OK&amp;account\_id=ABC&amp;funding\_instrument_id=DEF&amp;signature=jDSHDkHJIFXpPLVxtA3a9d4bPjM%3D

### Shared Key use / renewal

The signing algorithm should have the ability to repeat itself with multiple keys. This will allow multiple shared keys to be used, and enables cycling shared keys on a periodic basis.
 

### partner\_managed\_funding_instrument creation

If the fi\_description parameter is given, and no existing partner\_managed\_funding\_instrument with the same name exists in the account, a new partner\_managed\_funding\_instrument will be created, and all existing partner\_managed\_funding\_instruments will be paused.

If a partner\_managed\_funding_instrument with the same name exists, no new one will be created.
 

### Repeated on-boarding flow calls / token refresh

The on-boarding flow can be repeated in case the API access token was lost. The on-boarding flow implementation will require the user is logged in. If the user matches the promotable\_user\_id, and the associated ads account is found, and everything looks good, the user will be redirected back to the callback url, and the partner can initiate the OAuth flow to obtain an [access token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow).
 

### Non-redirectable error flow

If the account link url is invoked with invalid parameters, the user will be shown a page similar to the one shown in the OAuth flow when invalid or expired parameters are given.
 

#### Ongoing updates to the PMFI

Once the advertiser has been onboarded, the funding instrument can be managed using the [PUT accounts/:account_id/funding_instruments/:funding_instrument_id](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-funding-instruments) endpoint by only the partner who manages it.

### Placements

There are several places where Twitter ads can be displayed. This is set at the [line item](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#line-items) using the `placements` parameter. The possible values are:

* `ALL_ON_TWITTER`
* `PUBLISHER_NETWORK`
* `TWITTER_PROFILE`
* `TWITTER_SEARCH`
* `TWITTER_TIMELINE`

The line item’s `product_type` and `objective` determine which placements are allowed. The [GET line_items/placements](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#line-item-placements) endpoint can be used to retrieve the valid placement options for each product type.

Additionally, the following table lists the valid placement and objective combinations.

| Objective | `ALL_ON_TWITTER` | `TWITTER_PROFILE` | `TWITTER_SEARCH` | `TWITTER_TIMELINE` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `APP_ENGAGEMENTS` | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   |
| `APP_INSTALLS` | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   |
| `REACH` | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   |
| `FOLLOWERS` | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   |
| `ENGAGEMENTS` | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   |
| `VIDEO_VIEWS` | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   |
| `PREROLL_VIEWS` | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   |
| `WEBSITE_CLICKS` | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   |

**Note**: It is not possible to specify _only_ `TWITTER_PROFILE` placement.

**Note**: `TWITTER_SEARCH` requires [keyword targeting](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#targeting-options).

**Note**: The `REACH` objective must include `TWITTER_TIMELINE` placement. It can have either `ALL_ON_TWITTER`, any combination of placements that include `TWITTER_TIMELINE`, or `TWITTER_TIMELINE` on its own.

### Ad groups FAQ

This document is meant to be a collection of commonly asked questions about Ad Groups in Twitter's Ads API.

#### What is an Ad Group?


Ad groups, known as line items in the Ads API, exist under campaigns and are used for targeting and bidding against a set of Twitter users. Advertisers promote Tweets or media (e.g., videos that are promoted as In-stream ads) by associating them with a line item.

#### How do we create an Ad Group?

Ad Groups are created by calling [POST accounts/:account\_id/line\_items](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#post-accounts-account-id-line-items) multiple times for the same campaign ID, and keeping (possibly completely different) targeting and Tweets associated with those line items. There is a limit of 100 line items per campaign and a limit of 200 active campaigns for a single ads account. Across all campaigns, there is a limit of and 8,000 active line items per ads account.

#### Why should we add support for Ad Groups?


Ad Groups are intended to make it easier for advertisers to organize, optimize and manage their campaigns.

The advantage of Ad Groups is to compare and control different strategies across bid, budget, creative, and targeting. Upon associating multiple Promoted Tweets to a single line item, the auction would select the best Tweet from that group and then select the best Tweet for that campaign from all of the line items. If you have multiple Ad Groups with single Tweets, it would effectively select the Tweet that would likely perform better from that Ad Group.

Using Ad Groups enables an advertiser to split up targeting and bidding into a much greater number of possible combinations, and in general allows splitting up targeting into logical groups.

Ads API tools in particular could be built around fine tuned optimization rules with Ad Groups that would be more difficult to do via manual edits due to the larger scale of line item and creative combinations.

#### How does the line item budget relate to campaign budget in an Ad Groups campaign?

The total\_budget\_amount\_local\_micro for a line item cannot exceed the total budget for its parent campaign. Similarly, the line item’s bid\_amount\_local_micro value should not exceed daily\_budget\_amount\_local\_micro or total\_budget\_amount\_local\_micro of the parent campaign. Setting these values incorrectly may put the overall campaign into a paused and unservable state.

Note that the total campaign budget can be less than the sum of the budgets of its child line items, and distribution of budget between line items is partially up to the Ads API tool to effectively optimize and change as daily performance of targeting (line item) could differ significantly day to day due to Twitter’s realtime nature.

#### Do Ad Groups perform better than single line items?

The performance of a campaign depends upon many factors and effectively a Tweet is the final deciding factor of performance. A Line Item will be treated as a factor of whether or not a Tweet is even in the running to be served to a user.

Line items that target the same sets of users are considered to have overlap of users. It is considered a best practice to reduce this overlap of targeting between line items so that the highest performing sets of users can be clearly identified.

## Guides

### Video Views Preroll Objective

The following guide outlines the steps required to set up a PREROLL_VIEWS campaign on the Ads API. Broadly speaking these campaigns are split into two types, Curated Categories and Content Categories (referred to as Standard Categories on the Ads UI).

#### Steps


#### Upload the video

Uploading the video involves 2 steps:

#### Upload the video media

First, using the [Chunked media upload](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/media/upload-media/uploading-media/chunked-media-upload) endpoint, you will upload the video to Twitter for processing. You must pass the `media_category=amplify_video` on the initial `INIT` using this endpoint. You’ll upload the video in chunks. Once the `STATUS` returns a `state` of `succeeded` you may continue with the next steps. More on the uploading of media using the chunked endpoint can be found in our [Promoted Video Overview](/x-ads-api/creatives#promoted-video).

#### Add the video to the ads account

Once the state returned using the `STATUS` command is `succeeded`, you’ll use the media_key returned from that endpoint to add the video to the advertiser’s media library, using the [POST accounts/:account\_id/media\_library](/x-ads-api/creatives#media-library) endpoint.

#### Setup the campaign

### Campaign Creation

Create the [campaign](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#post-accounts-account-id-campaigns) and [line item/ad group](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#campaigns). Line items should be created with an `objective` of `VIDEO_VIEWS_PREROLL`, and a `product_type` of `MEDIA`. The `categories` parameter must also be set to the appropriate [advertiser business categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#advertiser-business-categories).
```json

  }
}
```
### Line Item Creation

Line items must have the categories parameter set to the appropriate set of IAB categories, retrieved via the [GET content_categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#content-categories) endpoint. These content categories each correspond to one or more IAB categories.

In order to use these values, partners must select an appropriate content category and use the entire set of iab_categories returned in the response, to set the categories parameter on the line items endpoint. Any partial application of the iab_categories will result in the entire group being set on the line item. For example,

#### Publisher Selection

An advertiser may choose to target either a Content Category or a Curated Category, with additional details described below. 

**Note:**  Line items may target either Curated or Content  Categories but not both. 

### Curated Categories

Curated Categories allow advertisers to target a preset group of publishers and can be retrieved using the  [GET curated_categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#curated-categories-2) endpoint. These categories are country specific, and therefore require that the line item target the appropriate country based on the country_code of the category.

In order to use one of these categories, the following steps are required in the specific order listed:

1.  The line item needs to target the appropriate country based on the country_code of the Curated Category
2.  The [POST line\_item\_curated_categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#line-item-curated-categories) endpoint must be used to associate the line item with a specific curated\_category\_id. 

**Note:** Associating a line item with a curated category will also limit the number of publishers that can be denylisted to 5. The full list of user_id used to denylist specific publishers can be retrieved from the [GET publishers](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#publishers) endpoint. Additionally, a given line item may target no more than one Curated Category at a time.

The following example illustrates how to associate a curated category id: b0xt which is only available in the US, with the line item created in the previous step.

First, the line item’s targeting criteria is set to the the value 96683cc9126741d

    "updated_at": "2021-03-30T17:26:42Z",
    "deleted": false
  }
}
```

### Content Categories

Content categories, also referred to as Standard Categories can be retrieved from the [GET curated_categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-curated-categories) endpoint. These categories can then be targeted by the line item using the batch targeting criteria endpoints. The following example illustrates how to select a particular content category, id: sr which maps to “News & Current Events” and apply it to the line item.

<Note>
**Note**: The entire set of iab_categories in the [GET curated_categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-curated-categories) response must be targeted via the targeting criteria endpoint. Failing to do so will result in a validation error.

##### Associate the account media (video) with the line item


Use the [POST accounts/:account\_id/media\_creatives](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#post-accounts-account-id-media-creatives) endpoint to associate the video with an ad group.
```json
POST https://ads-api.x.com/8/accounts/55w3kv/media_creatives
line\_item\_id=4bii5&account\_media\_id=knb

{
 "data":{
   "account\_media\_id":"74g",
   "approval_status":"ACCEPTED",
   "created_at":"2016-02-11T22:23:23Z",
   "deleted":false,

 },
 "request":{
   "params":{
     "line\_item\_id":"4bii5",
     "account\_media\_id":"knb"
   }
 }
}
```
#### Set the CTA and destination URL


It is important to note that unlike most other campaigns on Twitter, the `VIDEO_VIEWS_PREROLL` objective does not utilize Promoted Tweets or Cards. Instead, the video creative is associated with your ad group (line item) and the CTA information is associated with a `preroll_call_to_action` entity. The [POST accounts/:account\_id/preroll\_call\_to\_action](/x-ads-api/creatives#preroll-call-to-actions) endpoint allows you to control the button CTA and the destination URL.
```json
POST https://ads-api.x.com/8/accounts/55w3kv/preroll\_call\_to_action
line\_item\_id=4bii5&call\_to\_action=VISIT\_SITE&call\_to\_action\_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAdsAPI

{
 "data":{
   "id":"aaa111",
   "line\_item\_id":"4bii5",
   "call\_to\_action":"WATCH_NOW",
   "call\_to\_action_url":"https://twitter.com/AdsAPI",
   "created_at":"2016-02-11T22:23:23Z",
   "updated_at":"2016-02-11T22:23:23Z",
   "deleted":false
 },
 "request":{
   "params":{
     "line\_item\_id":"4bii5",
     "call\_to\_action":"VISIT_SITE",
     "call\_to\_action_url":"https://twitter.com/AdsAPI"
   }
 }
}
```
#### Set targeting criteria


The targetting criterion utilized for pre-roll video ads is only avaialble using our batch targeting criteria endpoint [POST batch/accounts/:account\_id/targeting\_criteria](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#post-batch-accounts-account-id-targeting-criteria).

Use `CONTENT_PUBLISHER_USER` as negated targeting to exclude the ad from being paired with a set of users. Provide the Twitter `user_id`  or publisher\_user\_id for the handles to exclude.

The [GET publishers](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#publishers) endpoint can be used to retrieve the list of user_id to exclude for Content Categories. The publisher\_user\_id returned in the [GET curated_categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#curated-categories-2) response can be used to retrieve a similar exclusion list for Curated Categories.

**Note:** A maximum of 5 publisher\_user\_id can be excluded for Curated Categories and 50 user_id for Content Categories.
```json

#### Analytics

Analytics for `VIDEO_VIEWS_PREROLL` campaigns are available using our stats endpoints.

### Keyword Targeting in Timelines
Keyword targeting is fundamental to our Promoted Tweets products, giving campaigns better reach. Keyword targeting in timeline enables platforms to target Twitter users based on keywords in their recent Tweets. For example, if an advertiser is targeting the unordered keyword combination “plan + trip”, and a user Tweets, “I’m starting to plan my trip to Cabo, any suggestions?” while the campaign is running, that user may soon afterward see the advertiser’s Promoted Tweet.

#### How does it work?

TL;DR: from an API standpoint, this change is quite simple: you can now target keywords on Promoted Tweets in Timeline. Just set the `targeting_type` to `unordered_keywords` or `phrase_keywords` for line items.

#### Quick Start Guide

* Create a new line item with the placement set to include either `ALL_ON_TWITTER` or `TWITTER_TIMELINE` [POST accounts/:account\_id/line\_items](https://dev.twitter.com/ads/reference/post/accounts/%3Aaccount_id/line_items)
* Create the targeting criteria for this newly created line item with either `BROAD_KEYWORD` and set your keyword value(s). [POST accounts/:account\_id/targeting\_criteria](https://dev.twitter.com/ads/reference/post/accounts/%3Aaccount_id/targeting_criteria)
* You can update the keywords with [PUT accounts/:account\_id/targeting\_criteria](https://dev.twitter.com/ads/reference/put/accounts/%3Aaccount_id/targeting_criteria)
* Once your campaign is running, get the stats on your line item to gauge performance. [GET stats/accounts/:account_id](https://dev.twitter.com/ads/reference/get/stats/accounts/%3Aaccount_id)

### Advertiser Business Categories
<Button href="https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/1d12b9fc623b8e149f87">
  Run in Postman
</Button>

#### GET advertiser\_business\_categories[](#get-advertiser-business-categories "Permalink to this headline")

Request the valid advertiser business `categories` for Ad Groups (`line_items`) to describe an advertiser's brand to publishers.

Note: These categories apply only to `line_items` with the `PREROLL_VIEWS` objective and are separate from the `content_categories` used for targeting criteria.

Each `advertiser_business_categories` represents a collection of [IAB Categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#iab-categories). When creating an Ad Group with the `PREROLL_VIEWS` objective, one or two `advertiser_business_categories` must be set for the Ad Group. This can be done by setting the value of the `categories` request parameter on the [line item](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#line-items) endpoint to the set of corresponding `iab_categories` available through this endpoint.

Additional details can be found in the [Video Views Preroll Objective Guide](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#video-views-preroll-objective)

#### GET content_categories[](#get-content-categories "Permalink to this headline")

Request the valid content `categories` to be set as `targeting_criteria` for a line item.

Each `content_category` maps to one or more [IAB Categories](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#iab-categories). This can be done by setting the `targeting_type` to `IAB_CATEGORY` on the batch `targeting_critera` endpoint to include the set of corresponding `iab_categories` returned by the `content_categories` request. Failure to do so will result in a validation error.

Publisher details for each of these content categories can be retrieved using the [GET publishers](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#publishers) endpoint.

Additional details can be found in the [Video Views Pre-roll Objective Guide](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#video-views-preroll-objective).

#### POST accounts/:account\_id/line\_items[](#post-accounts-account-id-line-items "Permalink to this headline")

Create a line item associated with the specified campaign belonging to the current account.

All line items within a campaign must be of the same `product_type` and `objective`.

When using the `PROMOTED_ACCOUNT` product type, associating a Tweet with the `line_item` will add timeline placements on mobile in addition to the standard `PROMOTED_ACCOUNT` placement.

Setting either `android_app_store_identifier` or `ios_app_store_identifier` will automatically add the targeting criteria for the line item matching the mobile app being promoted; for example, passing in `ios_app_store_identifier` would add `PLATFORM` [targeting criteria](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#targeting-options) for `iOS`.

**Note**: There is a limit of 100 line items per campaign and 256 active line items across all campaigns.

#### POST batch/accounts/:account\_id/line\_items[](#post-batch-accounts-account-id-line-items "Permalink to this headline")

Allows the batch creation of new [line items](#post-accounts-account-id-line-items) with a single request.

**Batch Requests**

* The current maximum batch size is 40.
* All parameters are sent in the request body and a `Content-Type` of `application/json` is required.
* Batch requests fail or succeed together as a group and all API responses for both error and success preserve the item order of the initial request.

**Batch Responses**

Batch API responses return an ordered collection of items. Otherwise, they are identical in structure to their corresponding single-item endpoints.

**Batch Errors**

* Request-level errors (eg. max batch size exceeded) are shown in the response under the `errors` object.
* Item-level errors (eg. missing required line item parameter) are shown in the response under the `operation_errors` object.

#### DELETE accounts/:account\_id/line\_items/:line\_item\_id[](#delete-accounts-account-id-line-items-line-item-id "Permalink to this headline")

Delete the specified line item belonging to the current account.

**Note**: Deleting a line item is not reversible and subsequent attempts to delete the resource will return HTTP 404.

**Note**: When a line item is deleted, its child promoted\_tweets are only returned in the GET accounts/:account\_id/promoted\_tweets and GET accounts/:account\_id/promoted\_tweets/:promoted\_tweet_id endpoints if `with_deleted=true` is specified in the request. These promoted_tweets are not actually deleted, though (`"deleted": false` in the response). We do not cascade deletes.

#### GET accounts/:account\_id/promotable\_users[](#get-accounts-account-id-promotable-users "Permalink to this headline")

Retrieve details for some or all promotable users associated with the current account.

The promotable user type is either `FULL` or `RETWEETS_ONLY`. This controls the type of content that is allowed to be promoted by the account. Advertisers must obtain permission to promote another user's content and contact Twitter to get them added to your account as a `RETWEETS_ONLY` promotable user.

Provided the permissions are set correctly, you can make requests to the promoted product endpoints that directly reference the Tweet ID of the Tweet you'd like to promote. You can use the [POST accounts/:account_id/promoted-tweets](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#promoted-tweets) endpoint to promote published Tweets and the [POST accounts/:account_id/scheduled-promoted-tweets](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#promoted-tweets) endpoint to promote another Twitter Ads account's Scheduled Tweets.

You do not have to retweet the target Tweet. When you promote a Tweet with this approach, the `tweet_id` that is returned will be different from the Tweet ID that was provided. Behind the scenes, the Tweet is being retweeted as a nullcasted Tweet and then promoted. The `tweet_id` that is returned corresponds to this new Tweet.

#### GET accounts/:account\_id/promotable\_users/:promotable\_user\_id[](#get-accounts-account-id-promotable-users-promotable-user-id "Permalink to this headline")

Retrieve a specific promotable user associated with the current account.

The promotable user type is either `FULL` or `RETWEETS_ONLY`. This controls the type of content that is allowed to be promoted by the account.

Advertisers must obtain permission to promote another user's content. Provided the permissions are set correctly, you can make requests to the promoted product endpoints that directly reference the Tweet ID of the Tweet you'd like to promote.

You do not have to retweet the target Tweet. When you promote a Tweet with this approach, the `tweet_id` that is returned will be different from the Tweet ID that was provided. Behind the scenes, the Tweet is being retweeted as a nullcasted Tweet and then promoted. The `tweet_id` that is returned corresponds to this new Tweet.

#### POST accounts/:account\_id/targeting\_criteria[](#post-accounts-account-id-targeting-criteria "Permalink to this headline")

See the [Targeting Options](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#targeting-options) page to find `targeting_value`s for specific targeting types. We recommend that you refresh all data weekly, to ensure that you are working with the latest set of targeting type values. We change values and available targeting criteria from time to time; while the majority of these don't change often, some do. There is no guarantee that these values will not change.

Use the `BROAD_KEYWORD`, `EXACT_KEYWORD`, `PHRASE_KEYWORD`, or `UNORDERED_KEYWORD` targeting types with the keywords specified in the `targeting_value`. Exclude keywords by using the `operator_type` request parameter set to `NE`. See [targeting keyword types](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#targeting) for a detailed description of each type.

**Note**: It is only possible to target a single age bucket per line item.

**Note**: To target a Custom Audience, that audience must be targetable. i.e., `targerable` _must_ equal `true`.

**Note**: When using targeting type `TV_SHOW`, there must be at least one `LOCATION` targeting criterion on the line item prior to setting the `TV_SHOW` targeting and all `LOCATION` must be within the same locale as the `TV_SHOW` being targeted.

#### POST batch/accounts/:account\_id/targeting\_criteria[](#post-batch-accounts-account-id-targeting-criteria "Permalink to this headline")

Allows the batch creation of new Targeting Criteria with a single request.

**Batch Requests**

* The current maximum batch size is 500.
* All parameters are sent in the request body and a `Content-Type` of `application/json` is required.
* Batch requests fail or succeed together as a group and all API responses for both error and success preserve the item order of the initial request.

**Batch Responses**

Batch API responses return an ordered collection of items. Otherwise, they are identical in structure to their corresponding single-item endpoints.

**Batch Errors**

* Request-level errors (eg. max batch size exceeded) are shown in the response under the `errors` object.
* Item-level errors (eg. missing required Targeting Criteria parameter) are shown in the response under the `operation_errors` object.

#### GET targeting_criteria/events[](#get-targeting-criteria-events "Permalink to this headline")

Discover available event-based targeting criteria for Promoted Products. Only one event can be targeted per line item.

**Note**: Events often exist across timezones, leading to complications when considering event times from cross-timezone perspectives. To simplify this, all event `start_time` and `end_time` values on this endpoint are represented in UTC±00:00, irrespective of the event's locale and timezone. This design should be kept in mind when querying and interacting with event `start_time` and `end_time` values. For example, Independence Day for the US is represented as `start_time=2017-07-04T00:00:00Z` and `end_time=2017-07-05T00:00:00Z` in UTC±00:00, and thus avoids the issue of this holiday existing across multiple timezones within the US.
