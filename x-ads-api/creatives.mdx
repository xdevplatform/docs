## Overview

Creatives are any entity that can be promoted in a campaign. Posts can include text, images, GIFs, videos, or cards. Cards can include images or videos.

Image, GIF, or video creatives are uploaded using either the [POST media/upload](/x-api/media/upload-media#post-media-upload) — a simple upload endpoint that only supports images — or the POST media/upload (chunked) endpoints. These can be added to

cards:
- POST accounts/:account_id/cards
Tweets:
- POST accounts/:account_id/tweets - To add cards to Tweets, use the card_uri parameter.
Scheduled Tweets:
- POST accounts/:account_id/scheduled_tweets

For additional details on cards, please see the Cards page. The Promoted Video page provides details on associating videos with cards or Tweets.

### Cards

The Ads API supports several card types that can be used in Tweets, which can then be promoted in campaigns. **Note**: once Tweeted, card details are publicly visible. This may include information about the user who owns the card.

#### Image

The following image specifications apply to assets used in [Cards](/x-ads-api/creatives#cards-2). Images must be 3MB or less and have an a width of at least 800px. In addition, we support the following width:height aspect ratios.

- Website: 1:1 and 1.91:1
- Image App Download: 1:1 and 1.91:1
- Poll: 1.91:1
- Image Conversation: 1.91:1
- Image Direct Message: 1.91:1

We support the following image formats: .bmp, .jpeg, and .png.

#### Video

The following video specifications apply to assets used in [Cards](/x-ads-api/creatives#cards-2). We support the following width:height aspect ratios.

- Video Website: 16:9 and 1:1
- Video App Download: 16:9 and 1:1
- Poll: 16:9
- Video Conversation: 16:9
- Video Direct Message: 16:9

### Promoted Video

This document provides a brief overview of the process for uploading and promoting video through the Ads API.

The Ads API supports Promoted Video in [Tweets](/x-ads-api/creatives#tweets-2) and in the following cards:

- [Video Website](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/ads-api-version-11/168814)
- [Video App Download](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/ads-api-version-11/168814)
- [Video Conversation](/x-ads-api/creatives#video-conversation-cards)

First, upload the video using the [POST media/upload (chunked)](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-upload-init.html) endpoint. Using the `media_id`, associate the video with an ads account using the POST accounts/:account\_id/videos endpoint. The video's `id`, sometimes referred to as the `media_key`, will be used in subsequent requests. This is a string that begins with an int, is followed by an underscore, and ends with a long value. As an example, see: `13_875943225764098048`.

#### Promoted Video in Tweets

To create a Tweet, use the [POST accounts/:account\_id/tweet](/x-ads-api/creatives#get-accounts-account-id-tweets) endpoint along with the video's `id`. In this step, you can also provide a video title, description, and call-to-action (CTA). These values are user-facing.

#### Promoted Video in Cards

Video App Download and Video Conversation cards support the ability to add a poster images. Upload an image to use in these cards using the [POST media/upload](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-upload.html) endpoint.

Create the card using one of the following endpoints:

- [POST accounts/:account\_id/cards/video\_website](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/ads-api-version-11/168814)
- [POST accounts/:account\_id/cards/video\_app\_download](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/ads-api-version-11/168814)
- [POST accounts/:account\_id/cards/video\_conversation](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/ads-api-version-11/168814)

using the video's `id` and, optionally, the image's `media_id` (for the poster image).

Finally, create the Tweet using the POST accounts/:account\_id/tweet endpoint. Cards are attached to Tweets using the `card_uri` parameter.

#### General Information

For detailed guidance on video uploading through the API, please see the [Video Upload Guide](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/media/upload-media/uploading-media.html).

Videos can also be promoted as pre-roll assets. See the [Video Views Pre-roll Objective Guide](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#video-views-preroll-objective) for a detailed explanation.

- (As of 2015-10-22) When uploading videos to be used in promoted content, the `media_category` parameter must be set with a value of `amplify_video` for all `INIT` command requests to the [POST media/upload (chunked)](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-upload-init.html) endpoint. Using this new param ensures that the video is asynchronously pre-processed and prepared for use in promoted content. The `STATUS` command can be used to check completion of asynchronous processing after video upload.
- The maximum promoted video length currently allowed is 10 mins with a file size of 500MB or less.
- Uploaded video should be either mp4 or mov.
- Uploaded video generally processes quickly, but processing times can vary depending on video length and file size.
- Uploaded poster images should be in png or jpg format. There are no aspect ratio or size requirements, but the poster image will be adjusted to fit the video player.

### Scheduled Tweets

#### Introduction

Scheduled Tweets allow an advertiser or user to create a Tweet that can be scheduled to go live at a later date. In addition to being able create and manage these Tweets, the API allows the ability to associate these Tweets with a line item, to be promoted once the Tweet goes live. This allows advertisers to stage create native Tweets and plan their campaign creatives in advance of any key initiatives. For example, staging a Tweet creative to live immediately upon a new product announcement.

The full set of functionality provided by the Scheduled Tweets API endpoints are listed below:

- Create, modify and view newly scheduled Tweets
- Associate a Scheduled Tweet with a line item
- Query and manage existing scheduled Tweets
- Once a Scheduled Tweet goes live, retrieve the live Tweet `id`

#### API Endpoints

The entire set of endpoints related to the above functionality is listed below:

#### Scheduled Tweet Management

- [GET accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_tweets](/x-ads-api/creatives#get-accounts-account-id-scheduled-tweets) (retrieve a list of all Scheduled Tweets)
- [GET accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_tweets/:scheduled\_tweet\_id](/x-ads-api/creatives#get-accounts-account-id-scheduled-tweets) (lookup a specific Scheduled Tweet using its `id`)
- [POST accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_tweets](/x-ads-api/creatives#post-accounts-account-id-scheduled-tweets) (create a new Scheduled Tweet)
- [PUT accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_tweets/:scheduled\_tweet\_id](/x-ads-api/creatives#example-request-39) (modify an existing Scheduled Tweet)
- [DELETE accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_tweets/:scheduled\_tweet\_id](/x-ads-api/creatives#example-request-40) (delete a Scheduled Tweet using its `id`)
- [GET accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_tweets/preview/:scheduled\_tweet\_id](/x-ads-api/creatives#scheduled-tweets-2) (preview an existing Scheduled Tweet)

#### Scheduled Promoted Tweets

- [GET accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_promoted\_tweets](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-scheduled-promoted-tweets) (retreive a list of all Scheduled Promoted Tweets)
- [GET accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_promoted\_tweets/:scheduled\_promoted\_tweet\_id](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#get-accounts-account-id-scheduled-promoted-tweets-scheduled-promoted-tweet-id) (lookup a Promoted Scheduled Tweet using its `id`)
- [POST accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_promoted\_tweets](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#post-accounts-account-id-scheduled-promoted-tweets) (create a new Scheduled Promoted Tweet)
- [DELETE accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_promoted\_tweets/:scheduled\_promoted\_tweet\_id](/x-ads-api/campaign-management#delete-accounts-account-id-scheduled-promoted-tweets-scheduled-promoted-tweet-id) (delete an existing Scheduled Promoted Tweet using its `id`)

#### Scheduled Tweet View

- [GET accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_tweets/preview/:scheduled\_tweet\_id](/x-ads-api/creatives#scheduled-tweets-2) (view an existing Scheduled Tweet)

Due to the nature of Scheduled Tweets being separate entities from “live” Tweets, there are two different sets of validations run on any creates or edits to these Tweets. The first set of validation rules are run during the Scheduled Tweet creation step, specifically:

#### Scheduled Tweet Create:

- Validate that the authenticated user has access to create organic Tweets for a given @handle Promoted-Only Tweet create privileges requires authenticated user to be an account user with [Tweet composer permissions](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/campaign-management/api-reference/authenticated-user-access#get-accounts-account-id-authenticated-user-access)
- Validate that there are no more than 30 Tweets that are scheduled to be created within a 15 minute window of the scheduled\_at time. A SCHEDULED\_TWEET\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED error message indicates that too many Scheduled Tweets have been scheduled within the same future, 15 minute time frame.  Advertisers will need to remove an existing Scheduled Tweet or move the scheduled\_at time earlier or later.

#### Scheduled Tweet goes "live":

- These validation rules are run at the scheduled\_at time and are identical to those applied on regular Tweet creation in the API. For example, a Scheduled Tweet will not go live and the scheduled\_status will be set to FAILED if the Scheduled Tweet contains both an image and a gif

#### Workflow

**Create a new Scheduled Tweet**

A new Scheduled Tweet can be created using the [POST accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_tweets](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/scheduled-tweets#post-accounts-account-id-scheduled-tweets) endpoint. This endpoint has the following required parameters, `scheduled_at` time along with the Tweet `text` if no media entities are included in the Tweet. In addition, this endpoint provides a few additional options that allow you to create a scheduled Tweet on behalf of another @handle via the `as_user_id` param along with the ability to add a card (`card_uri`) and any media (`media_ids`). Note, a Tweet can only contain entities of the same type, i.e., either Video, Gif or Image. The `nullcast` param controls whether the Tweet is a “Promoted-Only” Tweet or not. All newly created Scheduled Tweets are "Promoted-Only" (`nullcast=true`) by default. If `nullcast=false` then an Organic Scheduled Tweet is created

Once a Scheduled Tweet is successfully created, the response will contain an `id` field, which refers to the unique identifier of the Scheduled Tweet itself. In addition to this field, another field called `tweet_id` is also returned. This field is `null` initially, however once the Tweet goes live this field is populated with the ID of the “live” Tweet.

```
twurl -H 'ads-api.x.com' -X POST "/6/accounts/:account_id/scheduled_tweets" -d 'scheduled_at=2017-12-24T23:59:00Z&text=Happy Holidays!'
```

This will create the following Scheduled Tweet:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "text": "Happy Holidays!",
      "scheduled_at": "2017-12-24T23:59:00Z"
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "completed_at": null,
    "id_str": "917507899668099072",
    "text": "Happy Holidays!",
    "user_id": "3271358660",
    "scheduled_status": "SCHEDULED",
    "id": 917507899668099100,
    "nullcast": true,
    "created_at": "2017-10-09T21:51:44Z",
    "scheduled_at": "2017-12-24T23:59:00Z",
    "card_uri": null,
    "updated_at": "2017-10-09T21:51:44Z",
    "tweet_id": null,
    "media_keys": []
  }
}
```

Once this Scheduled Tweet goes live, the `tweet_id` field will be populated with the "live" Tweet's ID.

**View a Scheduled Tweet**

The [GET accounts/:account\_id/tweet\_previews](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/tweet-previews#get-accounts-account-id-tweet-previews) endpoint can then be used with the Scheduled Tweet `id` from the previous step to generate a preview of the Tweet. The API response will contain an iframe URL that is ready to be used to render a preview for the Scheduled Tweet. The relevant CSS and images will be served directly via X.

```
twurl -H ads-api.x.com -X GET "/6/accounts/18ce54bgxky/tweet_previews?tweet_type=SCHEDULED&tweet_ids=917507899668099072

    }
  ]
}
```

A sample view of the newly created Scheduled Tweet is shown above

**Associate a Scheduled Tweet with a line item**

While Scheduled Tweets can be used to create Organic Tweets, we also allow partners to create a “Promoted-Only” (`nullcast=true`) Tweet either one of which can be associated with a line item. In order to facilitate this, we provide a [POST accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_promoted\_tweets](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/campaign-management/api-reference/scheduled-promoted-tweets#post-accounts-account-id-scheduled-promoted-tweets) endpoint as well. This endpoint only allows a single Promoted Scheduled Tweet to be associated with a line item in a single API call. In order to associate multiple Scheduled Tweets to the same line item, multiple API calls are necessary.

Please note that it is not possible to modify an existing Scheduled Promoted Tweet.

```
twurl -H 'ads-api.x.com' -X POST "/6/accounts/:account_id/scheduled_promoted_tweets" -d 'line_item_id=a44qc&scheduled_tweet_id=917507899668099072'
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "line_item_id": "a44qc",
    "id": "26576",
    "created_at": "2017-10-09T22:24:16Z",
    "updated_at": "2017-10-09T22:24:16Z",
    "scheduled_tweet_id": "917507899668099072",
    "tweet_id": null,
    "deleted": false
  },
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "line_item_id": "a44qc",
      "scheduled_tweet_id": 917507899668099100,
      "account_id": "aaaaa"
    }
  }
}
```

This endpoint only creates an association between a given Scheduled Tweet and a line item. Once the campaign/line item flight dates are current, the line item with automatically start serving the corresponding “live” Tweet. While we do validate during this step that the Scheduled Tweet is in the `SCHEDULED` state, and that the given Scheduled Tweet is valid for the given objective, no other validations are run. Any remaining validation rules that apply to the line item and Scheduled Tweet are run when the Tweet goes “live”

In order to ensure that there are no issues with campaign serving it is recommend that the Scheduled Tweet be `scheduled_at` a time prior to the campaign/line item flight dates.

For example, let's say the Scheduled Tweet is set to go live after the campaign start date (and that there is only a single Tweet associated with a single line item), then the campaign will be `ACTIVE`, however given that the Scheduled Tweet is not live yet, there will be no creatives available for serving.

**Scheduled Tweet Management**

The remaining sets of endpoints allow API consumers to manage all their Scheduled Tweets and Scheduled Promoted Tweets. These APIs can be used to either return a list of all Scheduled Tweets optionally filtered by a given state as well as lookup a given Scheduled Tweet by its `id`.

#### What happens when a Scheduled Tweet goes live?

Once a given Scheduled Tweet is about to go live, or in other words at the `scheduled_at` time, the following updates are made:

- The “live” Tweet is created however this may have a latency of upto 1 second
- The `tweet_id` is added to the following entities:
- Scheduled Tweet
- Promoted Scheduled Tweet
- A new Promoted Tweet entity is created

#### Best Practices

The following best practices are recommended when creating or promoting Scheduled Tweets:

- Ensure that the Tweet is valid when creating the Scheduled Tweet (for example, a Tweet can only have either an Image, Video or Gif and not any combination of the three)
- Ensure that the campaign flight dates (i.e., the `start_time` and `end_time`) align with the `scheduled_at` time for the Scheduled Tweet
- Scheduled Tweets should not be scheduled for more than one year in the future (365 days)
- Tweet preview is currently not supported for Scheduled Tweets (this is ability to preview Scheduled Tweets prior to creation)

### Media Library

#### Introduction

The Media Library endpoints provide the ability to manage images, GIFs, and videos for X Ads accounts. Media assets in the library can be used in Tweets and to create cards. They can also be reused in multiple [creatives](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/overview), eliminating the need to upload the same asset multiple times.

#### API Endpoints

- [POST media/upload](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-upload#post-media-upload) or [POST media/upload (chunked)](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-upload-init#post-media-upload-init) (upload media)
- [POST accounts/:account\_id/media\_library](https://developer.x.com/x-ads-api/creatives#get-accounts-account-id-media-library#post-accounts-account-id-media-library) (add media to the Media Library)

#### Adding to the Library

Adding media to the library is a two-step process. First, upload the asset using either the [POST media/upload](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-upload#post-media-upload) endpoint or the [POST media/upload (chunked)](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-upload-init#post-media-upload-init) set of endpoints. (See the [Chunked media upload](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/media/upload-media/uploading-media/chunked-media-upload) guide for details on our multi-part upload process.)

```
twurl -X POST -H upload.x.com "/1.1/media/upload.json?additional_owners=756201191646691328" --file latte.jpeg --file-field "media"
```

```json
{
   "media_id":966947208837742592,
   "media_id_string":"966947208837742592",
   "size":74194,
   "expires_after_secs":86400,
   "image":{
      "image_type":"image/jpeg",
      "w":800,
      "h":418
   }
}
```

Next, using the media ID, add the media to the ads account’s library using the [POST accounts/:account\_id/media\_library](https://developer.x.com/x-ads-api/creatives#get-accounts-account-id-media-library#post-accounts-account-id-media-library) endpoint.

```
twurl -X POST -H ads-api.x.com "/9/accounts/18ce54d4x5t/media_library?file_name=latte.jpeg&media_category=TWEET_IMAGE&media_key=966947208837742592&name=Latte"
```

```json
{
   "request":{
      "params":{
         "name":"Latte",
         "file_name":"latte.jpeg",
         "media_category":"TWEET_IMAGE",
         "account_id":"18ce54d4x5t",
         "media_key":966947208837742592
      }
   },
   "data":{
      "tweeted":false,
      "name":"Latte",
      "file_name":"latte.jpeg",
      "media_url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWtJXQNUQAAdPZj.jpg",
      "media_category":"TWEET_IMAGE",
      "media_key":"3_966947208837742592",
      "created_at":"2018-02-23T08:05:54Z",
      "media_status":"TRANSCODE_COMPLETED",
      "media_key":"966947208837742592",
      "media_type":"IMAGE",
      "updated_at":"2018-02-23T08:06:17Z",
      "deleted":false
   }
}
```

**Note:** Tweeting images, GIFs, or videos directly after the upload also adds media to the library.

#### Request Parameters

All Media Library POST requests require a media identifier. This value is returned during the upload step. When using the media\_id, as in the example above, a media\_category must also be specified. There are four possible category values: AMPLIFY\_VIDEO, TWEET\_GIF, TWEET\_IMAGE, and TWEET\_VIDEO.

Optionally, name and file\_name values can be set for objects in the Media Library. These attributes help users distinguish between media variants in the library.

For videos, it’s also possible to set a title and a description. They values are intended to be passed as the video\_title and video\_description request parameters with the [POST accounts/:account\_id/tweet](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/tweets#post-accounts-account-id-tweet) endpoint. In the Tweet, this text appears under the video.

#### Attributes

The Media Library, formally introduces the concept of the media\_key. This is the unique identifier for objects in the library. Media keys are string values in the following format: 13\_875943225764098048. These are fully supported in all of our card endpoints.

In addition, the Media Library response includes the media\_id, represented as a string. This is included for resources that do not currently accept a media key: [Tweets](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/tweets#post-accounts-account-id-tweet)\*, [Tweet preview](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/tweets#get-accounts-account-id-tweet-preview)\*, and [Scheduled Tweets](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/scheduled-tweets#post-accounts-account-id-scheduled-tweets). We are working toward supporting media keys everywhere.

The aspect\_ratio attribute is returned for GIFs and videos. This can be used to filter media for use in cards that only accept particular aspect ratios.

\*These endpoints support the video\_id parameter, which is a media key.

#### Usage

In this section, the following image will be used in a Tweet and to create a website card.

**Tweet**

We can create the Tweet by referencing the images using media\_keys.

```

**Website Card**

All of our cards endpoints support media keys. We will create the [website card](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/website#post-accounts-account-id-cards-website) by referencing the image’s media\_key.

```
twurl -X POST -H ads-api.x.com "/11/accounts/18ce54d4x5t/cards"
```

```json
{
  "name": "components create cards",
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "MEDIA",
      "media_key": "3_1323490622599176192"
    },
    {
      "type": "BUTTON",
      "label": {
        "type": "ENUM",
        "value": "INSTALL"
      },
      "destination": {
        "type": "APP",
        "country_code": "US",
        "googleplay_app_id": "com.twitter.android"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

We then associate this card with a Tweet using its card\_uri.

### Identifying Cards

#### Introduction

Cards are customizable ad formats that use media and that can be associated with a website, an app, or with calls to action to drive certain user engagements, such as starting a Direct Message. They can be appended to Tweets, Scheduled Tweets, or Draft Tweets.

Cards may be referenced in Tweet objects in one of two ways: by the card's card\_uri or by its preview\_url. Example values for each are presented below.

| card\_uri | preview\_url |
| :--- | :--- |
| card://1043282691834048513 | https://cards.x.com/cards/18ce54d4x5t/68w3s |

**Note**: As of Ads API version 3, only the card\_uri is generated and returned in the cards response for newly created cards.

**Note**: As of Ads API version 5, the preview\_url in the cards response is no longer returned.

The type of reference in the Tweet object response will depend on the way the Tweet was created. In other words, if the Tweet was created using the card\_uri request parameter, the card URI value will appear in the response. If the preview\_url was included as part of the Tweet text, on the other hand, the preview URL will appear in the response.

#### Identifying Tweets with card\_uri

For Tweets created using the card's URI value, find the reference to the card in the card\_uri response attribute. The example response below uses the [GET accounts/:account\_id/tweets](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/tweets#get-accounts-account-id-tweets) endpoint.

```
$ twurl -H ads-api.x.com "/9/accounts/18ce54d4x5t/tweets?trim_user=true&tweet_type=PUBLISHED&tweet_ids=1043551275923591168"
{
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "tweet_ids": [
        "1043551275923591168"
      ],
      "tweet_type": "PUBLISHED",
      "trim_user": true,
      "account_id": "18ce54d4x5t"
    }
  },
  "next_cursor": null,
  "data": [
    {
      "coordinates": null,
      "retweeted": false,
      "source": "Ads API Internal Test App",
      "entities": {
        "hashtags": [],
        "symbols": [],
        "user_mentions": [],
        "urls": []
      },
      "display_text_range": [
        0,
        15
      ],
      "favorite_count": 0,
      "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null,
      "geo": null,
      "id_str": "1043551275923591168",
      "scopes": {
        "followers": false
      },
      "in_reply_to_user_id": null,
      "truncated": false,
      "retweet_count": 0,
      "scheduled_status": null,
      "id": 1043551275923591168,
      "in_reply_to_status_id": null,
      "nullcast": true,
      "created_at": "Sat Sep 22 17:23:07 +0000 2018",
      "place": null,
      "scheduled_at": null,
      "tweet_type": "PUBLISHED",
      "favorited": false,
      "card_uri": "card://1043282691834048513",
      "full_text": "Tracking a card",
      "lang": "en",
      "contributors": [
        2417045708
      ],
      "in_reply_to_screen_name": null,
      "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null,
      "user": {
        "id": 756201191646691328,
        "id_str": "756201191646691328"
      },
      "tweet_id": "1043551275923591168"
    }
  ]
}
```

If using the Standard API, use include\_card\_uri=true in the request.

Regardless of which endpoint is used, the card\_uri response attribute will only be rendered if the Tweet was created using a card URI.

For scheduled and draft Tweet objects, the response will always include the card\_uri response attribute.

#### Identifying Tweets with preview\_url

For Tweets created by including the preview URL as part of the Tweet's text, the URL can be found in entities\["urls"\]\[i\]\["expanded\_url"\] (the text field includes a shortened t.co URL), where i is an array index (a Tweet can contain multiple URLs).

For scheduled and draft Tweet objects, the preview URL will always appear in the text field.

#### Fetching cards

To retrieve additional information about a specific card, we provide two endpoints: [GET accounts/:account\_id/cards/all](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/cards-fetch.html#get-accounts-account-id-cards-all) and [GET accounts/:account\_id/cards/all/:card\_id](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/cards-fetch#get-accounts-account-id-cards-all-card-id). The former allows a card to be fetched by card\_uri and the latter by the card's ID. The card's ID is found at the end of the preview\_url. In the example above, the ID is 68w3s.

### Identifying Media

#### Introduction

Media—images, GIFs, and videos—can be added to Tweets and cards. In addition, videos can be used as pre-roll assets and images can be promoted on the [X Audience Platform](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/ads/measurement/overview/twitter-audience-platform). This section describes how to find media references across these entities.

There are two types of media identifiers: IDs and keys. Example values for each are presented below.

| **Media ID** | **Media key** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1029825579531807971 | 13\_1029825579531807971 |

The media key is the ID plus a numeric prefix and an underscore.

#### Images

The following table shows the identifier types currently available in each image-related resource's response as well as the corresponding attribute name(s).

| **Resource** | **Identifier** | **Attribute(s)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Image cards | None |  |
| Tweet | Both | `entities["media"]["id_str"]`  `entities["media"]["media_key"]` |
| Scheduled Tweet | Both | `media_ids` and `media_keys` |
| Draft Tweet | Both | `media_ids` and `media_keys` |
| Account Media | None |  |
| Media Library | Both | `media_id` and `media_key` |

Image cards and Account Media images do not include a reference any media identifier. Tweets only include media IDs. Scheduled and Draft Tweets include both the media ID and media key. The Media Library returns both, too.

For Tweets, the id and id\_str fields in the object within the entities\["media"\] array correspond to the media ID. In cases where a Tweet includes multiple images, the references to each media entity can only found in extended\_entities\["media"\].

In addition to references to identifiers, it's often important to have access to the image's URL.

| **Resource** | **Attribute(s)** | **Format** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Image cards | `image` | .jpg |
| Tweet\* | `entities["media"][0]["media_url"]` or `extended_entities["media"][i]["media_url"]` | .jpg |
| Scheduled Tweet | None |  |
| Draft Tweet | None |  |
| Account Media | `media_url` | .jpg |
| Media Library | `media_url` | .jpg |

\* This URL locations depend on whether the Tweet contains a single image or multiple images.

All image cards include an image response attribute that contains the X image URL. (For image app download cards, the name is wide\_app\_image.)

For Tweets, the media URL location depends on both the type of media and the endpoint being used. For Tweets with a single image, the URL can be found in entities\["media"\]\[0\]\["media\_url"\]. This is true for both the Ads API and the Standard API. When Tweets contain multiple images, however, the URLs can only be found extended\_entities\["media"\]\[i\]\["media\_url"\]. This is only available in the Standard API.

#### Videos

The following table shows the identifier types currently available in each video-related resource's response as well as the corresponding attribute name(s).

| **Resource** | **Identifier** | **Attribute(s)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Video cards | May be either | `video_content_id` |
| Video poll cards | None |  |
| Tweet | Both | `entities["media"]["id_str"]`  `entities["media"]["media_key"]` |
| Scheduled Tweet | Both | `media_ids` and `media_keys` |
| Draft Tweet | Both | `media_ids` and `media_keys` |
| Account Media | Media key | `video_id` |
| Media Library | Both | `media_id` and `media_key` |

While video cards (with the exception of poll cards with video) include a video\_content\_id response attribute, there is inconsistency in the type of value returned. In some cases, it's a media ID; in others, it's a media key.

Information about how to access the video's URL is shown below.

| **Resource** | **Attribute(s)** | **Format** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Video cards | `video_url` and `video_hls_url` | .vmap  .m3u8 |
| Tweet with video | `extended_entities["media"][i]["video_info"]["variants"][j]["url"]` | .mp4 |
| Scheduled Tweet | None |  |
| Draft Tweet | None |  |
| Account Media | None |  |
| Media Library | `media_url` | .mp4 |


Video cards include video\_url and video\_hls\_url response attributes with .vmap and .m3u8 URLs, respectively.

#### Media Library

It's sometimes necessary to retrieve additional information about a media asset. One use case, for video cards, is retrieving the mp4 URL instead of the vmap one. This is available in the Media Library. For details on the available information, see our [Media Library Guide](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/guides/media-library). Most assets belonging to the ads account's FULL promotable user can be found in the library. There are some exceptions, though.

**Fetching media**

As stated above, image cards do not contain references to either media IDs or media keys. As a result, it's not possible to fetch their assets through the Media Library. This is also true for [Account Media](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/creatives/api-reference/account-media#account-media) images.

Video cards require that the video asset be part of the Media Library (or the Videos resource before it) prior to creating it. As a result, these assets will always be retrievable in the Media Library. This is also true for Account Media PREROLL assets.

Finally, media in Tweets are always guaranteed to be in the Media Library.

The following table summarizes which assets are retrievable in the Media Library, taking into account whether the resource response includes an identifier to use in the lookup.

| **Resource** | **In the Media Library** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Image cards | No |
| Video cards | Yes\* |
| Tweets (any media)\*\* | Yes |
| Scheduled Tweets | Yes |
| Draft Tweets | Yes |
| Account media images | No |
| Account media videos (`PREROLL`) | Yes |

\* For cards where the `video_content_id` is a media key. When the value is a media ID, the asset still exists in the Media Library, but retrieving it involves appending a numeric prefix and underscore to it.
\*\* Tweets only return media IDs. While the asset is guaranteed to exist in the Media Library, fetching it involves appending a numeric prefix and underscore to it.

**Interactions with Account Media**

There are two cases where media assets added to the library are automatically added to the Account Media resource.

- When an AMPLIFY\_VIDEO asset is added to the Media Library, it is automatically added as an Account Media asset as a PREROLL creative type.
- When images that have specific dimensions (see "Creative Types" in our [enumerations page](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/general/overview/enums)) are added to the Media Library, they are automatically added as Account Media assets. The creative type (e.g., INTERSTITIAL) depends on the image dimensions.

### Tweets

#### Introduction

The X Ads API supports three types of Tweets: published, scheduled, and draft.

#### Nullcasted Tweets

Tweets may either be nullcasted (a.k.a. "Promoted-only") or organic. Nullcasted Tweets, once published, do not appear in the user's public timeline, though they are public. Organic Tweets, on the other hand, are served to the user's followers and do appear in the user's public timeline.

**Creating Tweets**

Each of the three Tweet create endpoints supports a Boolean nullcast parameter that gives the API user the option to create nullcasted or organic Tweets. Nullcasted Tweets can be created by the user or by anyone who has permission to create Tweets on the user's behalf. Organic Tweets can only be created by the [full promotable user](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tutorials/ads-api-hierarchy-terminology#promotable-users).

**Updating Tweets**

It is possible to update the nullcast property for scheduled and draft Tweets. For scheduled Tweets, edits can be made until the Tweet's scheduled\_at time. Draft Tweets can be edited indefinitely. Once published, though, it's not possible to change a Tweet from nullcasted to organic or vice versa.

#### Promoting Tweets

Only published and scheduled Tweets may be promoted. These can either be nullcasted or organic; there's no restriction. An advertiser may promote their own Tweets or another user's Tweets as long as they've obtained permission to do so. (See: [Promoting another user's Tweets](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tutorials/promoting-another-users-content) for more information.)

Multiple Tweets can be promoted in a single campaign. Similarly, a single Tweet may be promoted in one or more campaigns.

To promote published Tweets, use the [POST accounts/:account\_id/promoted\_tweets endpoint](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/campaign-management/api-reference/promoted-tweets#post-accounts-account-id-promoted-tweets). This associates published Tweets with a line item. To promote scheduled Tweets, use the [POST accounts/:account\_id/scheduled\_promoted\_tweets](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/ads/campaign-management/api-reference/scheduled-promoted-tweets#post-accounts-account-id-scheduled-promoted-tweets) endpoint.

#### Tweet IDs

Published, scheduled, and draft Tweet IDs are [numeric](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/basics/twitter-ids)—they are 64-bit unsigned integers. For example, the following published Tweet's ID is 1166476031668015104.

When published or scheduled Tweets are promoted, a corresponding promoted Tweet entity is created. These entities have their own IDs, which are alpha-numeric and are represented as base-36-encoded values. For example, promoting the published Tweet above—that is, associating it a line item 6c62d—returns the following API response.

```
$ twurl -X POST -H ads-api.x.com "/9/accounts/18ce54d4x5t/promoted_tweets?line_item_id=6c62d&tweet_ids=1166476031668015104"
{
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "tweet_ids": [
        1166476031668015104
      ],
      "line_item_id": "6c62d",
      "account_id": "18ce54d4x5t"
    }
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "line_item_id": "6c62d",
      "id": "3qwlq6",
      "entity_status": "ACTIVE",
      "created_at": "2019-09-12T21:39:10Z",
      "updated_at": "2019-09-12T21:39:10Z",
      "approval_status": "ACCEPTED",
      "tweet_id": "1166476031668015104",
      "deleted": false
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 1
}
```

In addition to the Tweet ID and the line item ID, which were passed into the create request, the response includes an id field with a value of 3qw1q6, which is the promoted Tweet ID.

### Carousels

#### Introduction

The X Ads API supports creating and retrieving video carousels and image carousels. The carousel is a card type that can contain between 2 and 6 media assets. The carousel card can direct a user to a website or encourage them to install a mobile app. For more information about carousels, their benefits, best practices, and FAQs, see our [Carousel Ads on X](https://business.x.com/en/advertising/carousels.html) page.

A carousel, like any other card type, can be used in Tweets and those Tweets can then be promoted. The workflow is the same as what you're already used to:

1. Upload media
2. Create the card
3. Create the Tweet
4. Promote the Tweet

The only difference is with how the card is created. While other card create requests accept query parameters, carousel card create requests only accept JSON POST bodies.

#### Endpoints

The Ads API supports creating and retrieving carousels.

To create a carousel—any kind—use the [POST accounts/:account\_id/cards](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/api-reference/cards#post-accounts-account-id-cards) endpoint. To retrieve carousels, use the [GET accounts/:account\_id/cards](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/api-reference/cards#get-accounts-account-id-cards) endpoint.

#### JSON POST Body

Carousels are created using two components. The first specifies the media assets that will be used. The second specifies information about either the website or the app.

Specifically, a carousel card is created by using the following components, in order:

- One `SWIPEABLE_MEDIA`component, which accepts an array of media keys
- *One* of the following:
- A `DETAILS` component to specify website information
- A `BUTTON` component to specify app information

The `SWIPEABLE_MEDIA` component must include a `media_keys` array where you can specify between 2 and 6 images or videos. The order in which the media keys are passed in determine the order in which they will be rendered.

```
{
  "type": "SWIPEABLE_MEDIA",
  "media_keys": [
    "13_1089771253848666112",
    "13_1191948012077092867"
  ]
}
```

As a reminder, you can obtain media keys by making a request to the [GET accounts/:account\_id/media\_library](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/api-reference/media-library#get-accounts-account-id-media-library) endpoint.

The composition of the second component object depends on whether you wish to direct a user to a website or encourage them to install an app. The table below summarizes the two options. (**Note**: all of the listed keys are required.)

|  | **Website** | **App** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Specify the component type | `"type": "DETAILS"` | `"type": "BUTTON"` |
| Title/Label | `"title": "X"` | `"label": { "type": "ENUM", "value": "INSTALL" }` |
| Destination | `"destination": { "type": "WEBSITE", "url": "https://www.x.com" }` | `"destination": { "type": "APP", ... }` |

Putting this together, an example website carousel JSON POST body is shown below.

```
{
  "name": "website carousel",

}
```

App destination objects within `BUTTON` components require a country code and at least one app identifier. They optionally accept deep links. For a description of these fields, see the [reference documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/api-reference/cards#app-destination).

Putting this together, an example app carousel JSON POST body is shown below.

```

    {
      "type": "SWIPEABLE_MEDIA",
      "media_keys": [
        "13_1089771253848666112",
        "13_1191948012077092867"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "BUTTON",
      "label": {
        "type": "ENUM",
        "value": "INSTALL"
      },

}
```

#### Example

This section demonstrates how to create a video website carousel card and how to use it in a Tweet. As mentioned above, the workflow is the same as what you're already used to: upload media, create the card, create the Tweet. The only difference is how the card is created.

**Media**

To start, either upload new media assets or use existing ones. For details on how to upload new media assets and add them to the Media Library, see our [Media Library Guide](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/guides/media-library).

Once your media assets are in the Media Library, fetch them using the [GET accounts/:account\_id/media\_library](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/api-reference/media-library#get-accounts-account-id-media-library) endpoint. Use the `media_type` request parameter to scope the results to a particular media type.

```
$ twurl -H ads-api.x.com "/10/accounts/18ce54d4x5t/media_library?media_type=VIDEO"
```
```
{
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "account_id": "18ce54d4x5t",
      "media_type": "VIDEO"
    }
  },

}
```

**Carousel Creation**

Use the [POST accounts/:account\_id/cards](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/api-reference/cards#post-accounts-account-id-cards) endpoint to create your carousel. Use the media keys from the previous request. Remember, the order in which the media keys are passed in determine the order in which they are rendered.

```
$ twurl -A "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -H ads-api.x.com "/10/accounts/18ce54d4x5t/cards" -d '{"name":"website carousel","components":[{"type": "SWIPEABLE_MEDIA","media_keys":["13_1089771253848666112","13_1191948012077092867"]},{"type": "DETAILS","title": "X","destination":{"type":"WEBSITE", "url":"https://www.x.com"}}]}'
```
```
{
  "request": {
    "params": {
      "account_id": "18ce54d4x5t"
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "name": "website carousel",
    "components": [
      {
        "type": "SWIPEABLE_MEDIA",
        "media_keys": [
          "13_1089771253848666112",
          "13_1191948012077092867"
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "DETAILS",
        "title": "X",
        "destination": {
          "type": "WEBSITE",
          "url": "https://www.x.com/",
          "tco_url": "https://t.co/dyTMHWKWZb"
        }
      }
    ],
    "id": "ars7m",
    "created_at": "2020-11-11T07:51:47Z",
    "card_uri": "card://1326432421105995776",
    "updated_at": "2020-11-11T07:51:47Z",
    "deleted": false,
    "card_type": "UNIFIED"
  }
}
```

Notice that like with other cards, the carousel card response includes a `card_uri`, which will be used when creating a Tweet.

**Tweet**

Use the [POST accounts/:account\_id/tweet](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/api-reference/tweets#post-accounts-account-id-tweet) endpoint to create your Tweet. Use the `card_uri` from the previous request. (Response truncated for readability.)

### creative-metadata-tagging

#### Introduction

This guide is for creative partners, agencies and creative developers to tag assets used within X campaigns to better understand individual asset value and performance.

**Note:** Media assets must only be tagged by the partner or developer creating the media asset. If the user of the media asset did not create the media asset, do not implement metadata tagging.

Creative Metadata Tagging provides attribution of images and videos created by Creative Partners wherever the asset is uploaded to X, or whomever the entity that is uploading the asset. To create the connection between the creative asset and the creative partner, the [XMP](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/XMP.html) standard is used.

#### Tagging Creative Assets

The following table shows the identifier types currently available in each image-related resource's response as well as the corresponding attribute name(s). A tagging tool is needed to tag creative assets. [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/), a platform-independent Perl library plus a [command-line application](https://exiftool.org/exiftool_pod.html) for reading, writing, and editing meta information, is recommended. See all supported [file types](https://exiftool.org/#supported).

Follow the provided [instructions to install ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/install.html). There are also software packages offered by [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/) to further simplify the installation by providing the [exiftool install command](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/exiftool) for macOS and Linux. Confirm your tool is properly installed by entering exiftool -ver in the command line to return the tool’s version number. Learn more about ExifTool command parameters in [ExifTool documentation](https://exiftool.org/).

Creative partners can assign metadata tags on new or existing creative assets with their X app\_id to the contributor XMP tag, and date tag. The creative assets will follow the existing size restrictions when [Uploading Media](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/media/upload-media/overview). 

**Note:** X's use of the contributor XMP tag ensures metadata captures values for campaigns on X exclusively.

`exiftool -contributor="<YOUR APP ID>" -creative_file.jpg`

`exiftool -date="<date>" -creative_file.jpg`

The app\_id  can be found in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard) under Projects & Apps. Example: 16489123

The following example adds app\_id as the contributor tag and date as the date tag for an image:

```
app_id:858382169
```
```
date:2022-03-13
```
```
creative_file: eiffel_tower.jpg
```
```
exiftool -contributor=858382169 eiffel_tower.jpg
```
```
   1 image files updated
```
```
exiftool -date=2022-03-13 eiffel_tower.jpg
```
```
  1 image files updated
```

Verify that your image has been properly tagged: 

`exiftool -xmp:all -G1 <filename>`

Example:

`exiftool -xmp:all -G1 eiffel_tower.jpg`

```
[XMP]        XMP Toolkit            : Image::ExifTool 12.30
```
```
[XMP]        Contributor            : 858382169
```
```
[XMP]        Date                   : 2022:03:13
```

#### Questions?

If you would like to confirm that your tagging and attribution is successful, please provide sample assets that have been tagged to adsapi-program@x.com for a X representative to review.

#### POST accounts/:account_id/cards

Create a new card associated to the specified account.

Card create requests only accept JSON POST bodies. The `Content-Type` must be set to `application/json`.

See our [Carousels Guide](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/creatives/guides/carousels) for a detailed usage example.

#### Resource URL

`https://ads-api.x.com/12/accounts/:account_id/cards`

#### Parameters

The JSON POST body must include a card `name` and an array of `components`. Components are represented as objects and describe the advertiser-facing attributes of the card.

The following example shows the general structure of the payload (but includes non-working information).

```
{
  "name": "some name",
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "TYPE_ENUM",
      "key": "value"
    }
  ]
}
```

Additional information on components below.

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| account\_id   *required* | The identifier for the leveraged account. Appears within the resource's path and is generally a required parameter for all Advertiser API requests excluding [GET accounts](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/ads/campaign-management/api-reference/accounts#get-accounts). The specified account must be associated with the authenticated user.  Type: string  Example: `18ce54d4x5t` |
| name   *required* | The name for the card. Maximum length: 80 characters.  Type: string  Example: `component based card` |
| components   *sometimes required* | Describes the components to use to create the card. Additional information below.  Cannot be specified along with `slides`.  **Note**: The order of the components is important.  Type: array of objects |
| slides   *sometimes required* | Use this array of array to create Multi-Destination Carousels.  Describes each card as a grouping of components. Each slide should be a complete representation of a card.  Cannot be specified along with `components`.  **Note**: The order of each slide is important.  Type: array of array |

#### Components

Every component must include a `type` field which determines the object's schema. The Ads API supports the following component types, grouped into media- and description-based components.

- Media:
- `MEDIA`: single video or image
- `SWIPEABLE_MEDIA`: between 2-6 videos or images
- Description:
- `DETAILS`
- `BUTTON`

Each component has a set of required fields (in addition to the `type` key). These are listed in the following table.

| Component `type` | Field | Value type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `MEDIA` | `media_key` | string |
| `SWIPEABLE_MEDIA` | `media_keys` | array of strings |
| `DETAILS` | `title`   `destination` | string   object |
| `BUTTON` | `label`   `destination` | object   object |

The following is an example of a `BUTTON` component in the context of the `components` array (intentionally omitting the `name` key). (The ellipses indicate places where more information would need to be specified.)

```
{
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "BUTTON",
      "label": {
        ...
      },
      "destination": {
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The order in which the component objects are specified defines the top-to-bottom order in which they will be rendered. Cards must be created using one media-based component and either a `DETAILS` or `BUTTON` component. Description-based components are rendered under media and have associated destinations, either URLs or mobile apps.

**Label**

Labels define the text shown on buttons and, therefore, only apply to the `BUTTON` component. Label objects have two required keys: `type` and `value`. The `type` must be set to `ENUM` and the `value` can be one of: `BOOK`, `CONNECT`, `INSTALL`, `OPEN`, `ORDER`, `PLAY`, or `SHOP`.

Building on the previous example, the following shows the `label` object within the `BUTTON` component.

```
{
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "BUTTON",
      "label": {
        "type": "ENUM",
        "value": "INSTALL"
      },
      "destination": {
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Destination**

Destinations are where advertisers intend to take users. They are always required within `DETAILS` or `BUTTON` components. There are two destination types: `WEBSITE` or `APP`.

**Note**: Website destinations can only be used with `DETAILS` components and app destinations can only be used with `BUTTON` components.

**Website Destination**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| type   *required* | The destination type, which determines its schema.  Type: enum  Possible values: `WEBSITE` |
| url   *required* | The URL of the website to redirect a user to.  Type: string  Example: `https://devcommunity.x.com/c/advertiser-api` |

**App Destination**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| type   *required* | The destination type, which determines its schema.  Type: enum  Possible values: `APP` |
| country\_code   *required* | The [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) two-letter code for the country where the app is sold.  Type: string  Example: `US` |
| googleplay\_app\_id   *sometimes required* | The Google Play application package name.  **Note**: At least one of following is required: `ios_app_store_identifier` or `googleplay_app_id`.  Type: string  Example: `com.twitter.android` |
| ios\_app\_store\_identifier   *sometimes required* | The iOS app store identifier.  **Note**: At least one of following is required: `ios_app_store_identifier` or `googleplay_app_id`.  Type: string  Example: `333903271` |
| googleplay\_deep\_link   *optional* | A deep link into the Android app you're promoting.  **Note**: Can only be used if an `googleplay_app_id` has been provided.  Type: string |
| ios\_deep\_link   *optional* | A deep link into the iOS app you're promoting.  **Note**: Can only be used if an `ios_app_store_identifier` has been provided.  Type: string |

#### POST accounts/:account_id/tweet

Create a Tweet for the account's full promotable user (default) or the user specified in the `as_user_id` parameter. Both nullcasted (default) and organic Tweet creation is supported. Nullcasted Tweets do not appear in the public timeline and are not served to followers. Either type can be used in campaigns.

If the authenticated user is not the `FULL` promotable user on this account, determine if they have permission to Tweet on behalf this user by making a request to the [GET accounts/:account\_id/authenticated\_user\_access](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/ads/campaign-management/api-reference/authenticated-user-access#get-accounts-account-id-authenticated-user-access) endpoint. A permission of `TWEET_COMPOSER` indicates that the user may use this endpoint to create nullcasted Tweets on behalf of the `FULL` [promotable user](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/ads/campaign-management/api-reference/promotable-users#get-accounts-account-id-promotable-users).

When using the [upload.x.com endpoint](https://developer.x.com/rest/reference/post/media/upload) for media, pass in the same `user_id` value for the `additional_owners` parameter as the `as_user_id` value that you pass in to this endpoint.
