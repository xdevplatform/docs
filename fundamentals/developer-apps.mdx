Apps are containers for your API credentials. Each app has its own keys, tokens, and settings.

---

## App credentials

When you create an app, you can generate these credentials:

| Credential | Use case |
|:-----------|:---------|
| **API Key & Secret** | Authenticate with OAuth 1.0a. Used to sign requests or generate user tokens. |
| **Access Token & Secret** | Make requests on behalf of your own account (OAuth 1.0a). |
| **Client ID & Secret** | Authenticate with OAuth 2.0. Used for authorization code flow. |
| **Bearer Token** | App-only authentication for public data endpoints. |

<Tip>
Choose **OAuth 2.0** for new projects. It offers fine-grained scopes and is required for X API v2 user-context endpoints.
</Tip>

## Creating an app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Developer Console">
    Go to [console.x.com](https://console.x.com) and sign in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create App">
    Enter a name, description, and use case for your app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate credentials">
    After creation, generate the keys and tokens you need.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store securely">
    Save credentials immediately—they're only shown once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## App permissions (OAuth 1.0a)

OAuth 1.0a apps have three permission levels:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Read only">
    - View posts, users, and public data
    - Cannot post, like, or modify anything
    - Cannot access Direct Messages
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Read and write">
    - All read permissions
    - Post and delete posts
    - Follow/unfollow users
    - Like and repost
    - Cannot access Direct Messages
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Read, write, and DMs">
    - All read and write permissions
    - Send and read Direct Messages
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Changing permissions requires users to re-authorize your app to get new tokens with the updated scope.
</Note>

---

## OAuth 2.0 app types

When configuring OAuth 2.0, select your app type:

| Type | Client | Use case |
|:-----|:-------|:---------|
| **Web App** | Confidential | Server-side applications that can securely store secrets |
| **Automated App / Bot** | Confidential | Bots and automated services running on servers |
| **Native App** | Public | Mobile or desktop apps that can't secure secrets |
| **Single Page App** | Public | Browser-based JavaScript apps |

**Confidential clients** receive a Client Secret. **Public clients** use PKCE only.

---

## Callback URLs

Callback URLs (redirect URIs) are required for OAuth flows. After a user authorizes your app, they're redirected to your callback URL with an authorization code.

### Requirements

- Add callback URLs to your app's allowlist in the Developer Console
- URLs must match exactly (including trailing slashes)
- Maximum of **10 callback URLs** per app
- Use `https://` in production
- For local development, use `http://127.0.0.1` (not `localhost`)

### Disallowed protocols

These protocols cannot be used: `javascript`, `data`, `file`, `ftp`, `mailto`, `telnet`, and other non-standard schemes.

<Accordion title="Full list of disallowed protocols">
`vbscript`, `javascript`, `vbs`, `data`, `mocha`, `keyword`, `livescript`, `ftp`, `file`, `gopher`, `acrobat`, `callto`, `daap`, `itpc`, `itms`, `firefoxurl`, `hcp`, `ldap`, `mailto`, `mmst`, `mmsu`, `msbd`, `rtsp`, `mso-offdap`, `snews`, `news`, `nntp`, `outlook`, `stssync`, `rlogin`, `telnet`, `tn3270`, `shell`, `sip`
</Accordion>

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use separate apps" icon="layer-group">
    Create different apps for development, staging, and production.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate credentials" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Regenerate keys periodically and if you suspect a compromise.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minimal permissions" icon="shield-check">
    Request only the permissions your app actually needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor usage" icon="chart-simple">
    Check the Developer Console regularly to track API usage.
  </Card>

## Automated account labels

If your app runs a bot account, you can label it as automated:

1. Go to your bot account's **Settings**
2. Select **Your account** → **Automation**
3. Link your managing account

This builds trust with users and distinguishes your bot from spam.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Callback URL not approved error">
Ensure your callback URL is exactly as registered in the Developer Console, including protocol and any trailing slashes. HTTP-encode the URL when passing it as a query parameter.

```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "code": 415,
    "message": "Callback URL not approved for this client application."
  }]
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="App suspended">
If your app shows as suspended, check your email for a notice from the X platform team. Use the [Platform Help Form](https://help.x.com/forms/platform) to appeal.
