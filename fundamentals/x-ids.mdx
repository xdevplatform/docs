Every object in the X API—posts, users, lists, DMs, spaces—has a unique ID. Understanding how these IDs work helps you build reliable integrations.

## ID format

X IDs are **64-bit unsigned integers** generated using a system called "Snowflake." Each ID encodes:

- **Timestamp** — When the object was created
- **Worker number** — Which server generated the ID
- **Sequence number** — Order within that millisecond

This means IDs are roughly time-ordered: higher IDs generally represent newer objects.

<Tip>
IDs are globally unique across all of X, not just within a single object type.
</Tip>

## String vs. integer representation

<Warning>
**Always use string IDs in your code.** Some programming languages (like JavaScript) can't accurately represent 64-bit integers.
</Warning>

In JavaScript, integers are limited to 53 bits. This causes precision loss with large IDs:

```javascript
// This loses precision!
const id = 10765432100123456789;
console.log(id.toString()); // "10765432100123458000" — wrong!

// Use strings instead
const id = "10765432100123456789";
console.log(id); // "10765432100123456789" — correct!
```

### API versions

| Version | ID format |
|:--------|:----------|
| **X API v2** | IDs are returned as strings by default |
| **X API v1.1** | Returns both `id` (integer) and `id_str` (string) — always use `id_str` |

## Working with IDs

### Storing IDs

Store IDs as strings or 64-bit integers in your database:

| Database | Recommended type |
|:---------|:-----------------|
| PostgreSQL | `BIGINT` or `TEXT` |
| MySQL | `BIGINT UNSIGNED` or `VARCHAR(20)` |
| MongoDB | String |
| SQLite | `TEXT` (SQLite integers max at 63 bits) |

### Comparing IDs

When comparing IDs for chronological ordering:

```python
# Python - safe for 64-bit integers
if int(id1) > int(id2):
    print("id1 is newer")

# JavaScript - compare as strings (lexicographically works for same-length IDs)
# Or use BigInt
if (BigInt(id1) > BigInt(id2)) {
    console.log("id1 is newer");
}
```

## Common ID types

| Object | Example ID | Notes |
|:-------|:-----------|:------|
| Post (Tweet) | `1234567890123456789` | Also called Tweet ID |
| User | `2244994945` | Older accounts have shorter IDs |
| List | `1234567890` | |
| Space | `1YqGodQbNXDxv` | Alphanumeric, not Snowflake format |
| DM Event | `1234567890123456789` | |
