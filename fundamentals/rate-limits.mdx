Everyday many thousands of developers make requests to the X developer platform. To help manage the sheer volume of these requests, limits are placed on the number of requests that can be made. These limits help us provide the reliable and scalable API that our developer community relies on. 

Each of our APIs use rate limits in different ways. To learn more about these differences between platforms, please review the specific rate limit pages within our specific API sections:

- [X API v2](/x-api/fundamentals/rate-limits)
- [X API: Enterprise](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rate-limits)
- [X Ads API](/x-ads-api/fundamentals/rate-limiting)
