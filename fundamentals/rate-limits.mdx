Rate limits control how many API requests you can make in a given time period. They ensure fair usage and system stability across the platform.

## Rate limits by product

Each X API product has its own rate limiting approach:

    Per-endpoint limits based on 15-minute windows. View detailed tables and recovery tips.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enterprise API" icon="building" href="/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rate-limits">
    Custom limits based on your enterprise agreement and data package.

    Limits specific to ad management and analytics endpoints.

## How rate limits work

| Concept | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Time window** | Most limits reset every 15 minutes |
| **Per-user limits** | Apply when using OAuth 1.0a or OAuth 2.0 user tokens |
| **Per-app limits** | Apply when using Bearer Token (app-only) authentication |
| **Endpoint-specific** | Each endpoint has its own limit |

---

## Checking your limits

Every API response includes headers showing your current rate limit status:

```
x-rate-limit-limit: 900
x-rate-limit-remaining: 847
x-rate-limit-reset: 1705420800
```

| Header | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `x-rate-limit-limit` | Maximum requests allowed in the current window |
| `x-rate-limit-remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `x-rate-limit-reset` | Unix timestamp when the limit resets |

---

## Rate limit errors

When you exceed a rate limit, you'll receive a **429 Too Many Requests** response:

```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "code": 88,
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded"
  }]
}
```

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cache responses" icon="database">
    Store API responses locally to reduce repeated requests for the same data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use exponential backoff" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    When rate limited, wait before retrying. Double the wait time with each retry.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Check headers" icon="list-check">
    Monitor rate limit headers to avoid hitting limits proactively.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use streaming" icon="signal-stream">
    For real-time data, use filtered stream instead of polling search endpoints.
  </Card>
