## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up for a developer account">
    Go to [console.x.com](https://console.x.com) and sign in with your X account. Accept the Developer Agreement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first app">
    Click **New App** and provide a name and description. This generates your API credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your credentials">
    Copy and securely store your API Key, API Secret, and Access Tokens. These won't be shown again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start building">
    Use your credentials to authenticate API requests. Check out the [quickstart guide](/x-api/getting-started/make-your-first-request).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Store credentials securely.** API keys and tokens are only displayed once when generated. Use a password manager or secure vault. If lost, you'll need to regenerate them, which invalidates the old credentials.
</Warning>

## Billing & credits

The X API uses pay-per-usage pricing with a credit-based system:

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **No monthly fees** | Pay only for what you use—no subscriptions |
| **Credit-based** | Purchase credits upfront, deducted as you use the API |
| **Real-time tracking** | Monitor usage and costs in the console dashboard |
| **Per-endpoint pricing** | Different endpoints have different costs |
| **Deduplication** | Same resource requested twice in 24 hours is only charged once |

View current pricing and purchase credits in the [Developer Console](https://console.x.com).
