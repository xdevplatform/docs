## Overview

### Introduction

The X developer portal contains a set of self-serve tools that developers can use to manage their access to the X API and X Ads API.

In the portal, you have the opportunity to:

- Create and manage your X [Projects](/resources/fundamentals/projects) and [Apps](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) (and the authentication keys and tokens that they provide).
- Manage your access levels and integrations with the X API standard v1.1 and v2 endpoints.
- Learn more about different endpoints and features available.

### Ready to get access?

You can get started using the X API by signing up for an account.

If you need additional functionality or higher [Tweet caps](/x-api/fundamentals/post-cap), you can purchase Basic or Pro within the developer portal. For those interested in Enterprise, please apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO3bczKWO2jFHyVZJUSEGfdyfFaqt2MvmOfl_aJp0KxMqtDA/viewform).

## What to expect within the developer portal

### Onboarding

The onboarding wizard guides you through the process of setting up your first [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) and [App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps). You will need to create a Project and App to receive the credentials required to authenticate your API requests. You will see the wizard if you are accessing your developer account for the first time.

Through this process, you will receive a set of authentication keys and tokens, which you can learn more about on our [App overview page](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps#overview). To learn more about what is needed to authenticate with the X API, take a look at the [authentication section](/resources/fundamentals/authentication).

**Please note:** You will need to [store your keys and tokens in a secure location](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/guides/authentication-best-practices) so you can access them later on. There is no way to reference these credentials without regenerating them.

### Project and App management

One of the primary roles of the developer account is to enable to you [manage your Projects and Apps](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps#app-management). Developers can both create and manage X Projects and Apps from the Dashboard in the developer portal. This is where you can find your App IDs; edit an App's setting, permissions, and callback URLs; and generate and revoke keys and tokens.

### Learn more about what's available with X API v2

The developer portal hosts a products section where you can go to learn more about the different versions and access levels of the X API.

The X API v2 product section contains important information about the Free, Basic, Pro, and Enterprise access tiers. This page contains details on Project-level App limitations, Tweet cap, and costs, as well as endpoint-specific rate limits and special attributes. You can also compare and contrast the different access levels and apply for additional access if available.

Review [all v2 access levels](/x-api/introduction#access-levels).

## Team management

<Note>
**Only available to Enterprise v2 accounts.**
</Note>

**[View the "team" page within the developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/teams).**

### Why use team functionality?

Team functionality facilitates collaborative development of Projects and Apps within the X Developer Platform. Often, teams have different people responsible for access control, billing/payments, and this allows you to invite those people to contribute to your project.

### Inviting team members

In order to invite someone to join a team, an admin can invite them via their X handle. They will receive an email and they can accept it via that email invitation. Once they accept, they will need to agree to the Developer Agreement & Policy, and can then access the main account's team page.

**Please note:** Team management does not currently grant/limit API access based on [App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) credentials. It is not possible to share App management across your team. Apps (keys/tokens) cannot be edited, created, or deleted by non-owners.

### Team dashboard

On the "members" tab of the team dashboard, you will view all the members and their roles. If you are an administrator of a team, you will be able to manage developer access and edit the roles of each member.

Administrators also have access to the "pending" tab of the team dashboard. Here, admins can view the details and manage each invitation that has been sent out.
