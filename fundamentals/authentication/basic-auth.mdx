## Basic authentication

Many of X's enterprise APIs require the use of HTTP Basic Authentication. To make a successful request to an API that requires Basic Authentication, you must pass a valid email address and password combination as an authorization header for each request. The email and password combination are the same ones that you will use to access the [enterprise API console](https://console.gnip.com/), and can be editted from within this console. 

When building a request using Basic Authentication, make sure you add the Authentication: Basic HTTP header with encoded credentials over HTTPS.

In the following cURL request example, you would replace `<email_address>` and `<password>` with your credentiails before sending the request:

```bash
curl -v --compressed -u<email_address>:<password>
    "https://gnip-api.x.com/search/30day/accounts/<account-name>/prod/counts.json?query=from%3Axdevelopers"
```
