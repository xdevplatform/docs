* X integration - The Log in with X flow can grant authorization to use X APIs on your users' behalf.
* OAuth based - A wealth of client libraries and example code are compatible with the Log in with X API.

## Available for

* Browsers - If your users can access a browser, you can integrate with Log in with X. Learn about the browser sign in flow.
* Mobile devices - Any web-connected mobile device can take advantage of Log in with X. Learn about the mobile sign in flow.

## Implementing Log in with X

The browser and mobile web implementations of Log in with X are based on OAuth. This page demonstrates the requests needed to obtain an access token for the sign in flow.

To use the “Log in with X" flow, please go to your [X app settings](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) and ensure that the _"Allow this app to be used to Sign in with X?_” option is enabled.

This page assumes that the reader knows how to sign requests using the OAuth 1.0a protocol. If you want to know how to sign a request, read the [Authorizing a request](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/authorizing-a-request) page.

If you want to check the signing of the requests on this page, the consumer secret used is: L8qq9PZyRg6ieKGEKhZolGC0vJWLw8iEJ88DRdyOg. This value is for test purposes and will not work for real requests.

The three steps for implementing Log in with X through obtaining a request token, redirecting a user, and converting a request token into an access token are listed below.
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Step 1">
### Step 1: Obtaining a request token

To start a sign-in flow, your [X app](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) must obtain a request token by sending a signed message to [POST oauth/request_token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/api-reference#post-oauth-request-token). The only unique parameter in this request is oauth_callback, which must be a URL-encoded version of the URL you wish your user to be redirected to when they complete step 2. The remaining parameters are added by the OAuth signing process.

<Note>
**Note:** Any [callback URL](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps#callback-urls) that you use with the [POST oauth/request_token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/api-reference#post-oauth-request-token) endpoint will have to be registered within the [X app settings](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) in the [developer portal](/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal).

**Example request (Authorization header has been wrapped):**

```
POST /oauth/request_token HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: themattharris' HTTP Client
Host: api.x.com
Accept: */*
Authorization:
        OAuth oauth_callback="http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fsign-in-with-twitter%2F",
              oauth_consumer_key="cChZNFj6T5R0TigYB9yd1w",
              oauth_nonce="ea9ec8429b68d6b77cd5600adbbb0456",
              oauth_signature="F1Li3tvehgcraF8DMJ7OyxO4w9Y%3D",
              oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",
              oauth_timestamp="1318467427",
              oauth_version="1.0"
```

Your app should examine the HTTP status of the response. Any value other than 200 indicates a failure. The body of the response will contain the oauth_token, oauth\_token\_secret, and oauth\_callback\_confirmed parameters. Your app should verify that oauth\_callback\_confirmed is true and store the other two values for the next steps.

**Example response (response body has been wrapped):**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 2011 00:57:06 GMT
Status: 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 146
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: Tue, 31 Mar 1981 05:00:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, pre-check=0, post-check=0
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Server: tfe

oauth_token=NPcudxy0yU5T3tBzho7iCotZ3cnetKwcTIRlX0iwRl0&
oauth_token_secret=veNRnAWe6inFuo8o2u8SLLZLjolYDmDP7SzL0YfYI&
oauth_callback_confirmed=true

```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Step 2">
### Step 2: Redirecting the user

The next step is to direct the user to X so that they may complete the appropriate flow, as described in Browser sign-in flow below. Direct the user to [GET oauth/authenticate](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/api-reference#get-oauth-authenticate), and the request token obtained in step 1 should be passed as the oauth_token parameter.

The most seamless way for a website to implement this would be to issue an HTTP 302 redirect as the response to the original “sign in” request. Mobile and desktop apps should open a new browser window or direct to the URL via an embedded web view.

**Example URL to redirect to:**

https://api.x.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=NPcudxy0yU5T3tBzho7iCotZ3cnetKwcTIRlX0iwRl0

The sign in endpoint will behave in one of three ways depending on the user’s status:

1.  **Signed in and approved**: If the user is signed in on x.com and has already approved the calling application, they will be immediately authenticated and returned to the callback URL with a valid OAuth request token. The redirect to x.com is not obvious to the user.
2.  **Signed in but not approved**: If the user is signed in to x.com but has not approved the calling application, a request to share access with the calling application will be shown. After accepting the authorization request, the user will be redirected to the callback URL with a valid OAuth request token.
3.  **Not signed in**: If the user is not signed in on x.com, they will be prompted to enter their credentials and grant access for the application to access their information on the same screen. Once signed in, the user will be returned to the callback URL with a valid OAuth request token.

Upon a successful authentication, your callback_url would receive a request containing the oauth_token and oauth_verifier parameters. Your application should verify that the token matches the request token received in step 1.

**Request from client’s redirect (querystring parameters wrapped):**

```
GET /sign-in-with-twitter/?
        oauth_token=NPcudxy0yU5T3tBzho7iCotZ3cnetKwcTIRlX0iwRl0&
        oauth_verifier=uw7NjWHT6OJ1MpJOXsHfNxoAhPKpgI8BlYDhxEjIBY HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8) AppleWebKit/535.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/16.0.891.1 Safari/535.5
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Referer: http://localhost/sign-in-with-twitter/
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Step 3">
### Step 3: Converting the request token to an access token

To render the request token into a usable access token, your application must make a request to the [POST oauth/access_token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/api-reference#post-oauth-access-token) endpoint, containing the oauth_verifier value obtained in step 2. The request token is also passed in the oauth_token portion of the header, but this will have been added by the signing process.

**Example request (Authorization header wrapped):**

```
POST /oauth/access_token HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: themattharris' HTTP Client
Host: api.x.com
Accept: */*
Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="cChZNFj6T5R0TigYB9yd1w",
                      oauth_nonce="a9900fe68e2573b27a37f10fbad6a755",
                      oauth_signature="39cipBtIOHEEnybAR4sATQTpl2I%3D",
                      oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",
                      oauth_timestamp="1318467427",
                      oauth_token="NPcudxy0yU5T3tBzho7iCotZ3cnetKwcTIRlX0iwRl0",
                      oauth_version="1.0"
Content-Length: 57
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

oauth_verifier=uw7NjWHT6OJ1MpJOXsHfNxoAhPKpgI8BlYDhxEjIBY
```
A successful response contains the oauth_token, oauth\_token\_secret parameters. The token and token secret should be stored and used for future authenticated requests to the X API. To determine the identity of the user, use [GET account/verify_credentials](https://dev.x.com/rest/reference/get/account/verify_credentials).

### Log in with X Resources

#### Client libraries

The client libraries listed at [X libraries](/resources/tools-and-libraries) will help implement Log in with X. Use the /oauth/authenticate endpoint, as described in the previous steps.

#### Buttons

X would prefer your application to use the following buttons for consistent branding. Save these images to host on your own servers.

Sign in with X (button style):

Sign in with X (link style):

  <img src="/images/sign-in-with-twitter-link.png" alt=""/>
</Frame></Tab>
<Tab title="Browser sign in flow">
The browser log in flow is appropriate for websites and applications which are able to open or embed a web browser. At a very high level:

* The application renders a “Sign in with X” link or button.
* The user clicks the sign in button.
* The current web browser is redirected to X (or a new browser is opened and directed to X).
* The user completes a login and authorization step at X if needed.
* X redirects back to an URL under the application’s control, passing authorization information for the user.

X keeps track of the authorizations, so for users already signed in to X.com who have authorized the application, no UI is shown - instead, they are automatically redirected back to the application.

### Desktop flow

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/browser_111.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>
To demonstrate the flows, pretend the website pictured above (“The greatest website ever created”) has implemented this API, as shown by the Sign in with X button on the landing page.

When the user clicks the Sign in button, the page they see depends on whether they are signed in and whether they have previously allowed the application to access their account.

When the user is signed in to x.com but has not granted access, a list of requested permissions, along with Sign In and Cancel buttons are shown.

When the user is not signed in to x.com input fields for a username and password will be shown. Note that even if the user has already granted access to the application, the list of permissions will still be shown.

<Frame>

</Frame>
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/browser_3.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/browser_4.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

After the user inputs valid credentials (if needed) and clicks “Sign In”, X will redirect the user to the website which started the sign in flow.

In the case where the user is already signed in to x.com and has granted access to the website, this redirect happens immediately.

The UI flow for mobile web browsers works exactly like the Browser sign in flow, but is optimized for mobile browsers.
