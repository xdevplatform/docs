X APIs handle enormous amounts of data. The way we ensure this data is secured for developers and users alike is through authentication. There are a few methods for authentication, each listed below.

Most developers will not need to deal with the complexities surrounding authentication since client libraries automatically handle these difficulties.

You can find a list of available client libraries on our [Tools and libraries](/resources/tools-and-libraries) page.

## Authentication methods

  <Card title="OAuth 1.0a User Context" href="/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret">
  OAuth 1.0a allows an authorized X developer App to access private account information or perform a X action on behalf of a X account.

  </Card>
  <Card title="App only" href="/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/overview">
  App only Access Token allows a X developer app to access information publicly available on X.
  <br/>

  <Card title="Basic authentication" href="/resources/fundamentals/authentication/basic-auth">
  Many of X's enterprise APIs require the use of HTTP Basic Authentication.

  <Card title="OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE" href="/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code">
  OAuth 2.0 User Context allows you to authenticate on behalf of another account with greater control over an application's scope, and authorization flows across multiple devices.

<Note>
**Note:**
Your App's API Keys and App only Access Token, as well as your personal Access Token and Access Token Secret can be obtained from the [X developer Apps](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) section found in the [developer portal](/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal).

**If you would like to make requests on behalf of another user**, you will need to generate a separate set of Access Tokens for that user using the [3-legged OAuth flow](https://developer.x.com/resources/fundamentals/authentication/obtaining-user-access-tokens), and pass that user's tokens with your OAuth 1.0a User Context or OAuth 2.0 user context requests.
