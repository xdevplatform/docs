### PIN-based authorization

The PIN-based OAuth flow is a version of the [3-legged OAuth](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens) process and is intended for applications that cannot access or embed a web browser to redirect the user after authorization. Examples of such applications would be command-line applications, embedded systems, game consoles, and certain types of mobile apps.

PIN-based OAuth flow is initiated by an app in the `request_token` with the `oauth_callback` set to `oob`. The term `oob` means out-of-band OAuth.  The user still visits X to login or authorize the app, but they will not be automatically redirected to the application upon approving access. Instead, they will see a numerical PIN code, with instructions to return to the application and enter this value.

<Note>
**Note:** The `callback_url` within the X app settings is still required, even when using PIN-based auth.

#### Implementing the PIN-based OAuth flow

The PIN-based flow is implemented in the same way as [3-legged authorization](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens) (and [Sign in with X](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#log-in-with-x)), with the following differences:

1.  The value for `oauth_callback` must be set to `oob` during the [POST oauth/request_token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/api-reference#post-oauth-request-token) call.

2.  After the user is sent to X to authorize your app using either a [GET oauth/authenticate](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/api-reference#get-oauth-authenticate) or [GET oauth/authorize URL](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/api-reference#get-oauth-authorize), they will not be redirected to your `callback_url`, instead they will see a screen with a X generated ~7 digit PIN with directions to enter the PIN into your applications name.

3.  The user enters this PIN into your application, and your application uses the PIN number as the `oauth_verifier` in the [POST oauth/access_token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/api-reference#post-oauth-access-token) to obtain an access_token.

<Note>
**Note:** PIN numbers are not reusable, and the `access_token` obtained should be used for application-user requests.
