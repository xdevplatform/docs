## I want to use multiple Post Buttons on my page. Is there anything I should know?

If you want to use more than one Post Button on a page you there are a couple of things you will want to check.

1. If you are using the JavaScript Post Button, make sure you only include the `widgets.js` JavaScript once. The best place to put the JavaScript is before the closing `</body>`
2. To avoid duplication of content on your page consider using the `rel="me"` and `rel="canonical"` tags in place of the via and url data points on each Post Button.

## Can I control the order of the recommended accounts?

Only two accounts are displayed and by default the via user is shown first with the first related account shown afterwards. If the user is a follower of the via user the Share Box will instead show the first two related accounts the user isn’t a follower of. No accounts are displayed if the user follows all of the suggested accounts (via and related).

## Does the Post Button work over HTTPS?
