## Tweet Actions

A Tweet action represents a possible action on a Tweet with an “on” state if the viewer has already completed the action.

All Tweet actions are displayed with a medium grey (#AAB8C2) fill in their default state. All Tweet actions should set 50% opacity when the action is being activated by the viewer (e.g. `:active` CSS pseudo). The action retains the previous fill color during its pressed / activation state, switching to the “on” state after the action becomes activated.

Retweet and like actions appear in an “on” state if the current viewer has performed the action. A `retweeted` or `favorited` [Tweet object](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#post-tweet) property set to true communicates the expected “on” display state.

A retweet action is turned off if the current viewer matches the author of the Tweet. A turned off action has 30% opacity.

The reply icon opacity should be adjusted during icon activation. A reply Tweet action does not have an “on” state: a new reply is always available.

The retweet icon opacity should be adjusted during icon activation. The retweet icon should appear in the “on” state if the Tweet object response for the current viewer has a `retweeted` property set to `true`. An inactive Tweet action state may exist when the current viewer is the same as the Tweet author.
