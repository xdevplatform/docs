Embedded timelines are an easy way to embed Posts on your website in a compact, linear view. Choose between a profile timeline to get the latest Posts from a X account, or a List timeline containing a curated list of Posts from your favorite X accounts.

An embedded timeline consists of two parts: including an embed code that links your webpage to the timeline on x.com, and the X for Websites JavaScript to transform the link into a fully-rendered timeline.

<Note>
**Please note:**

We retired the Likes, Collections, and Moments timelines on January 13, 2023.

We recommend you use the [Profile](/x-for-websites/timelines/guides/profile-timeline) and [Lists](/x-for-websites/timelines/guides/list-timeline) timelines, which we’re updating to become faster, easier to use, and more up-to-date with X features and functionality.

You can learn more about this change in our [announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/removing-support-for-embedded-like-collection-and-moment-timelines/150313).

## Timeline types

### Profile timeline

A profile timeline displays the latest Posts from the specified (public) X account.

### List timeline

A list timeline displays the latest Posts from a curated, public list of X accounts. The timeline includes a header displaying the list’s name, description, and curator. To create lists on x.com or in the X app, learn more here.

## Customization

### Dimensions

An embedded timeline automatically adjusts to the width of its parent element with a minimum width of 180 pixels and a maximum width of 520 pixels. The grid display has a minimum width of 220 pixels. Set the maximum width or the maximum height of an embedded timeline by adding a data-width or data-height attribute to the embed code anchor element.

```html
<a class="twitter-timeline"
  href="https://x.com/XDevelopers"
  data-width="300"
  data-height="300">
Posts by @XDevelopers
</a>
```

### Custom chrome

Control the frame around the linear timeline by setting a `data-chrome` attribute with space-separated tokens for each chrome component.

| Token          | Description                                                                                                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `noheader`     | Hides the timeline header. Implementing sites must add their own X attribution, link to the source timeline, and comply with other X [display requirements](https://about.x.com/company/display-requirements). |
| `nofooter`     | Hides the timeline footer and Post composer link, if included in the timeline widget type.                           |
| `noborders`    | Removes all borders within the widget including borders surrounding the widget area and separating Posts.            |
| `noscrollbar`  | Crops and hides the main timeline scrollbar, if visible. Please consider that hiding standard user interface components can affect the accessibility of your website. |
| `transparent`  | Removes the widget’s background color.                                                                                |

#### Example

```html
<a class="twitter-timeline"
  href="https://x.com/XDevelopers"
  data-chrome="nofooter noborders">
Posts by @XDevelopers
</a>
```

### Limiting the number of Posts displayed

Display a specific number of items between 1 and 20 by customizing your embed HTML.

Add a `data-tweet-limit` attribute to the embed code to specify a number of Posts. The timeline will automatically adjust its height to display a specified number of Posts. The timeline is fixed after display; it will not poll for new Posts until the page is refreshed.

#### Example

```html
<a class="twitter-timeline"
  href="https://x.com/XDevelopers"
  data-tweet-limit="3">
Posts by @XDevelopers
</a>
```

### Accessibility: Override ARIA live politeness

An embedded timeline describes its content for screen readers and other assistive technologies using additional markup defined in [WAI-ARIA standards](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php). A timeline widget is a [live region of a page](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/#liveprops) which will receive updates when new Posts become available.

By default, a timeline has a politeness value of `polite` by default; set a `data-aria-polite` attribute value of assertive to set the embedded timeline live region politeness to `assertive`, for example if you’re using the embedded Timeline as a primary source of live content in your page.

```html
<a class="twitter-timeline"
  href="https://x.com/XDevelopers"
  data-aria-polite="assertive">
Posts by @XDevelopers
</a>
```
