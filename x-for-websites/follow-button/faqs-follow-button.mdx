## What are the dimensions of the follow button?

The follow button is 20 pixels in height. Its width will vary depending on the language you have chosen (or the language of the viewer), the length of the specified `screen_name`, number of followers when `show_count` is active, etc. We recommend you make room for the `screen_name` value, and `show_count` value if you choose to display it.

Note if you use the JavaScript version of the Follow Button, you can specify the width using the `data-width` attribute. If you are using the iframe version you can use the `style` property.
