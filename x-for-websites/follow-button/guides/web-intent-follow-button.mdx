[Web Intents](/x-for-websites/web-intents/overview) display X actions optimized for display in a small browser window. A website may link to a follow web intent through a simple link on any website. X for Websites JavaScript widgets use the follow web intent to prompt viewers to follow an account.

A follow Web Intent window features an inline login form for logged-out X users.

The user will follow the account on successful login through the inline follow web intent login form. The follow status is confirmed by the “Following” button displayed in the web intent window.

We recommend rendering a Web Intent child window dimensions of at least 550 pixels wide and 420 pixels high.

## Web Intent URL

```
https://x.com/intent/follow
```

## Query parameters

A follow Web Intent must reference a X account by `screen_name` or `user_id`. A `screen_name` may change; we recommend using `user_id` whenever possible.
