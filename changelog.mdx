    `X API v2`

    Filtering/query operator "aliases" were added to search and filtered stream endpoints, across enterprise, premium, and v2.

In other cases, the new operator alias adds more clarity to the matching performed. For example., since posts can only have one video attachment, a new "has:video\_link" alias is provided for "has:videos."

    ### December 14th, 2021

    `X API v2: Authentication`

    Today, all developers can now authenticate using OAuth 2.0 by selecting OAuth 2.0 as an authentication method in the developer portal. We’ve added support for confidential and public clients and all relevant v2 endpoints to use this authentication method as part of this release. 

    OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization protocol that provides developers more control over an application’s scopes and improves authorization flows across multiple devices. In other words, developers building applications for people on X will have more control over the information their App requests from its users, so that you only have to ask your end-users for the data and information you need. 

    This modern authorization protocol will allow you to present your end-users with a more streamlined consent flow for authorizing your app, which only displays the specific scopes you have requested from them.

    To learn more about this launch, please visit our forum announcement.

    ### November 15th, 2021

    `X API v2: Early Access`

    **Major platform updates: X API v2 is now the primary version, new Essential and Elevated access, and Policy changes**

    Today, we are announcing that X API v2 is now the primary version of the X API. We have launched enough endpoints and functionality into X API v2 to satisfy the needs of 90% of all existing Apps built on the X API. 

    We are launching the following changes today to further improve upon the X API v2 developer experience:

    * Fast and free Essential access to the API, and free Elevated access to developers who have had their use cases approved. We have a lot more details on these access levels available on our About the X API page. 

    * We are removing language in our Developer Policy that restricted how you build with X’s core features, and limited the number of users you can support through your app.

      * We are opening up our platform to encourage you to build tools and products that make X better, healthier, and extend the public conversation. [See a list of solutions we’d love to see you build](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/what-to-build). 

      * Specifically, we’ve removed terms that restricted replication of the X experience, including X’s core features as well as terms that required permission to have high numbers of user tokens. 

      * We know that building solutions that help people on X often means a developer has to build (or replicate) some of the things that are available on X. These changes to our Developer Policy are intended to drive clarity for the developer ecosystem and provide an open API platform that makes it easier for developers to build, innovate, and make an impact on the public conversation.

    We go into a lot more detail on this launch and the X API launches that led to this moment in our [forum post](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/ushering-in-a-new-era-for-the-twitter-developer-platform-with-the-twitter-api-v2/162087). 

    In addition to exploring earlier changelog entries, we’ve put together some key resources that you can review to understand what all has released to X API v2 to-date:

    * [X API endpoint map](/x-api/migrate/x-api-endpoint-map)

    * [About the X API](/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api)

    OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard for authentication and will allow for a more modern authorization experience. 

    The OAuth 2.0 beta lets you test this new functionality in a v2 Project and associated App and give us feedback before a General Availability release. However, since this implementation of OAuth 2.0 is currently in development, we strongly recommend that you refrain from testing on a public, production environment, or app.

    The core search, pagination and other functionality of Recent Search will stay the same.

    We have put together some [migration materials](/x-api/migrate/overview) for when you update from v1 to v2.

    You can now retrieve engagement data for any post or list of posts from owned/authorized accounts. The posts you query must be no older than 30 days and cannot be reposts.

    [GET /tweets/metrics/private](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/labs/tweet-metrics/overview.html) supports the following metrics:

    * `impressions`

    * `reposts`

    * `quotes`

    * `likes`

    * `replies`

    * `video views`

    * `video view quartiles` (where the requester is also the author of the media)

    Learn more about this launch via our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/new-twitter-developer-labs-release-metrics-endpoint/129122).

    ### August 15th, 2019

    `X API: Standard v1.1`    

    Starting today, applications that need to create Direct Messages will be required to have "Read, Write, and Direct Messages" app permissions (RW+DM). Applications attempting to create Direct Messages with only the RW app permission will receive the following error:

    `{"code": 93,"message": "This application is not allowed to access or delete your direct messages."}`

    You can learn more about this change via our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/updates-to-app-permissions-direct-message-write-permission-change/128221).

    ### August 12th, 2019

    #### New expansion for GET /users: pinned post in X Developer Labs

    Learn more about this launch via our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/update-to-twitter-developer-labs/128060).

    ### July 25th, 2019

    `X API: Standard v1.1`     `X API: Premium v1.1`     `X API: Enterprise v1.1`    

    `X Ads API`     `X Ads API`     `X Developer Labs `   

    Today, all connections to the X API (and all other X domains) will require TLS 1.2.

    You can read more about this change in our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/removing-support-for-legacy-tls-versions-1-0-1-1-on-twitter/126648/2).

    ### July 15th, 2019

    `X API: Premium v1.1`     `X API: Enterprise v1.1`    

    Starting today, we are introducing the new [Account Activity API endpoint](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity#api-reference) to deactivate user subscriptions using application-only OAuth.

    This new endpoint offers developers the convenience of only having to provide a bearer token to deactivate a subscription, without requiring the subscribed user’s access token.

    We are immediately marking the existing enterprise Account Activity API endpoint used to deactivate user subscriptions with 3-Legged OAuth as deprecated. The endpoint will be retired and no longer be available starting from January 15, 2020.

    Developers can learn more about this API in our [documentation](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity#api-reference).

    ### June 20th, 2019

    #### New expansions for GET /tweets: referenced author and mentioned user

    `X Developer Labs `   

    We added two new expansions to the \[GET /tweets]https://developer.x.com/en/docs/labs/tweets-and-users/api-reference/get-tweets.html) endpoint:

    entities.mentions.username will expand the username of any recognized user mention in a post into a full user object.

    `referenced_tweets.id.author_id` expands the ID of the author of any referenced post, when one of the posts requested is a repost, Quoted post or Reply. This expansion will also expand the referenced post ID into a full object.

    ### June 11th, 2019

    #### GET /tweets and GET /users are now supported in Labs

    `X Developer Labs `   

    The first two endpoints are now available via the Labs portal. Make sure you have an approved developer account and have applied for Labs access to get started with these endpoints.

    [Key differences](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/labs/overview/whats-new) from equivalent v1.1 functionality include:

    * Single endpoint for single object "show" function and batch "lookups"

    * \[Expansion parameters]) support the inclusion of additional objects as part of one request (e.g. mentioned users, referenced posts, etc.)

    * \[Format parameters]) support different data projections with more or less verbose payloads

    * Rate limiting is at the app level, regardless of auth method (user context or bearer token)

    Learn more about this launch via our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/twitter-developer-labs-is-open-to-all-developers/126717).

    ### June 10th, 2019

    `X API: Standard v1.1`    

    We have fully retired the Terms of Service and Privacy Endpoints. The current status of our [Privacy Policy](https://x.com/en/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://x.com/en/tos) is best served by our up-to-date web pages.

    You can learn more about this change via our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/terms-of-service-and-privacy-endpoints-will-no-longer-serve-content-after-june-10/125714).  

    ### May 21st, 2019

    `X API: Standard v1.1`     `X API: Premium v1.1`     `X API: Enterprise v1.1`    

    Today some user object fields, including user.lang, will start returning 'null' for updated metadata fields previously announced in our [forum post](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/upcoming-changes-to-user-object-and-get-users-suggestions-endpoints/124732).

    Developers can learn about this change through our [documentation.](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#user)  

    ### May 20th, 2019

    `X API: Enterprise v1.1`    

    Starting today, we are introducing the [Account Activity Replay API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity), a data recovery tool available with the enterprise tier of the [Account Activity API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity)

    The [Account Activity Replay API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity) allows you to retrieve events from as far back as five days. It should be utilized to recover data in scenarios where your [webhook](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity#api-reference) server misses events

    Developers can learn more about this API in our [documentation](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity).  

    ### May 6th, 2019

    `X API: Enterprise v1.1 `   

    Starting today, native media (photos, videos, and GIFs) can be added to quotes on X, which will be shown as additional media metadata in the entities sections of quote payloads. 

    Developers can learn more about this in our [documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet).  

    ### February 13th, 2019

    `X API: Premium v1.1 `    `X API: Enterprise v1.1 `   

    Today, the operator is:reply becomes available to use with the [enterprise search APIs](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/search-api) and the paid version of the [premium search endpoints](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/premium-search).

    The is:reply Boolean operator can be used to filter all replies to posts, or to filter out explicit replies that match a rule. This operator functions in the same way as the is:quote operator. 

    Remember that, with the Search API, all ‘is:’ and ‘has:’ operators must be used in conjunction with a standalone operator like a keyword or hashtag.

    You can learn more about this operator in the [documentation](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rules-filtering).  

    ### February 6th, 2019

    `X API: Premium v1.1`     `X API: Enterprise v1.1`    

    Starting today, the expanded URL enrichment will no longer contain the unwound URL object and metadata (including the title and description fields) for URLs linking to posts, Moments, or profiles. Please note that other URLs (to websites, etc.) will continue to be enriched with this metadata, and the url, expanded\_url, and `display_url` will still be available. This change applies to [Decahose](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/decahose-api), [PowerTrack](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api), [Historical PowerTrack](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tweets/batch-historical/overview), and the [Search APIs](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/tweets/search/overview).  

    ### November 29th, 2018

    `X API: Enterprise v1.1 `   

    Today, we are introducing a new operator, is:reply, to help you narrow conversations to those you care about most. You can now filter out replies from your results (in addition to the pre-existing ability to filter out reposts, is:retweet, and Quoted posts, is:quote). This new operator is available today within [PowerTrack](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api), [Historical PowerTrack](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/tweets/batch-historical/overview), and [Replay](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/powertrack-api#replay-api).

    The is:reply Boolean operator can be used to filter all replies to posts, or to filter out explicit replies that match a rule. This operator functions in the same way as the is:quote operator.

    You can learn more about this operator in the [documentation](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/rules-filtering).  

    ### November 19th, 2018

    `X Ads API`     `X Ads API`     `X Developer Labs `   

    Today, we've added the ability for developers to view and edit their existing [X apps](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) via the [X app dashboard](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/apps) on developer.x.com as long as they're logged into their X account. Previously, you could only view and edit your existing X apps on developer.x.com if you had applied or been approved for a [developer account](/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal). 

    You still must have an approved developer account to be able to create new X apps.  

    ### November 7th, 2018

    `X API: Standard v1.1`     `X Ads API`    

    Today, we are announcing that advertisers and publishers are now able to add subtitle files (SRT) to their videos via ads.x.com, Media Studio and our publisher upload API. Subtitles will be viewable on auto-playing video (when no sound is available) on Android and Web. We will release the functionality for iOS in the coming weeks. 

    To read more about the new subtitles endpoints, please review their respective API reference pages:

    * [POST media/subtitles-create](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-subtitles-create)

    * [POST media/subtitles-delete](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-subtitles-delete)

    ### November 5th, 2018

    Today we are announcing an update to the [Account Activity API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity) endpoint, [GET subscriptions/count](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity#get-direct-messages-events-list#get-account-activity-subscriptions-count). To enable greater visibility into your billing details and use of the API, beginning today, you can programmatically pull the number of provisioned subscriptions associated with your Account Activity API instance within the JSON.  This means you can now see both what your provisioned number of subscriptions are, and how close you are to hitting that limit via the GET subscriptions/count API endpoint. 

    This update has been documented with the [Account Activity API documentation](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity#get-direct-messages-events-list#get-account-activity-subscriptions-count).  

    ### October 22nd, 2018

    `X API: Standard v1.1`    

    Today we are implementing new app-level rate limits on several of our standard POST endpoints:

    * [POST statuses/update](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-statuses-update)

    * [POST statuses/retweet/:id](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/get-statuses-retweets-id)

    * [POST favorites/create](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/post-friendships-create)

    * [POST direct\_messages/events/new](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/new-event)

    * [POST friendships/create](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/post-friendships-create)

    Today we are announcing an update to the [twitter-text](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text) library to account for the recent changes to the way that X counts emojis. If an emoji previously counted as more than two characters, its count will now be reduced to just two characters to allow for users to make the most out of their 280 characters.

    You can read more about this change in our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/new-update-to-the-twitter-text-library-emoji-character-count/114607).  

    ### September 17th, 2018

    `X API: Standard v1.1`    

    We have fully retired the legacy Direct Message endpoints. You can find a list of the retired DM endpoints, as well as their replacements on \[this page]\(https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference.

    You can learn more about this update via our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/details-and-what-to-expect-from-the-api-deprecations-this-week-on-august-16-2018/110746).  

    ### September 11th, 2018

    `X API: Standard v1.1`    

    Today we are implementing some changes to the process where you [retreive attached media from Direct Messages](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/v1/direct-messages/message-attachments/overview). We will no longer support accessing `media_url` or `media_url_https` via an authenticated www.x.com session. The request to fetch `media_url_https` MUST always be signed with the user’s access token using OAuth 1.0A. 

    You can learn more about this update via our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/direct-message-api-change-to-how-apps-can-access-images-sent-in-direct-messages/112722).

    You can learn more about this update via our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/details-and-what-to-expect-from-the-api-deprecations-this-week-on-august-16-2018/110746).  

    ### August 20th, 2018

    `X API: Enterprise v1.1`    

    Today we are launching a new version of the Usage API. With this update, we’re making the API more stable by moving to a new system.

    With the system update, users will experience a data "hole" as developers will only be able to pull data back to May 1, 2018. Therefore for the upcoming year, they will be missing out on a few months of historical data (until June 2019).

    A product name is changing within the Usage API from Historical PowerTrack Subscription to Historical PowerTrack 2.0 which will make the product naming consistent with the rest of our user-facing wording. Customers will receive the exact same data in the same format with the update. You will see this change within the products.type JSON object.

    If you have any questions, please reach out to your account manager.  

    ### August 16th, 2018

    `X API: Standard v1.1`     `X API: Enterprise v1.1`

    * [POST direct\_messages/destroy](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/direct-messages/sending-and-receiving/api-reference/delete-message)

    User Streams and Site Streams will be fully retired on August 23rd.

    The legacy Direct Messages endpoints will be fully retired on September 17th.

    You can learn more about this update via our [forum announcement](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/details-and-what-to-expect-from-the-api-deprecations-this-week-on-august-16-2018/110746).

    \* They will continue to be available on the account/settings endpoint, for authenticated users only.

    ### May 21st, 2018

    Today, we removed all Klout data from post payloads as part of our GDPR updates.

    ### May 14th, 2018

    `X API: Standard v1.1`     `X API: Premium v1.1`     `X API: Enterprise v1.1`    

    Today, we are changing all instances of profile\_background\_image\_url and profile\_background\_image\_url\_https to their default values. Please read our [forum post](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/upcoming-changes-to-the-developer-platform/104603) for more details.

    In addition to the above change, we are adding a new field to the [Account Activity API](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity) payloads to reference which subscription the activity was delivered for. This JSON object is called for\_user\_id and will include the subscribed user's ID who produced that activity as its value. You can see some examples of this new JSON object in our [account activity objects](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/account-activity#account-activity-data-object-structure) page.  

    ### May 10th, 2018

    `X API: Standard v1.1`     `X API: Premium v1.1`     `X API: Enterprise v1.1`    

    Today, we are announcing a change to the way that URLs will be rendered in the quote payload.

    We’re adding a new entity called the "quoted\_status\_permalink" entity to ensure the quoted post can be referenced and we will be removing the t.co link from the quoted post "text" field.

    With the new format, the t.co link is no longer appended to the "text" field of the quoted post in the "quoted\_status" object.

    Further, we will no longer put the quoted post t.co url, expanded\_url, and display\_url in the ‘urls’ entity. Instead, these will be added to a new "quoted\_status\_permalink" object with "url", "expanded", and "display" URL attributes. This means that the "quoted\_status\_permalink" object will be reserved for the t.co link back to the quoted post, whereas the "entities.urls" array can be used to identify any links shared within the original post or quote.

    Please read our [forum post](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/updating-how-urls-are-rendered-in-the-quote-tweet-payload/105473) and [updated documentation](https://devcommunity.x.com/t/upcoming-changes-to-the-developer-platform/104603) for more details.

This update addresses the change in our character limit that was rolled out on November 7th, 2017.

    ### November 14th, 2017

    `X API: Premium v1.1`    

    Launched the Premium APIs.

    These new APIs build on the quality and stability of our enterprise data platform, and make it available more widely via a tiered pricing model. For the first time, you can start to search across 30 days of posts (instead of the limited 7 days of data on the standard endpoint), and optionally, you can also access our premium enrichments for profile geo, URL expansion, and poll data. Here’s a taste of some of the new features:

    * More posts per request (Sandbox + Premium)

    * A far more rich query language enabling more complex queries (Sandbox + Premium)

    * A counts endpoint that returns time-series counts of posts (Premium)

    * Metadata enrichments, such as expanded URLs and Profile Geo (Premium)
