The news lookup endpoint allows developers to get news and headlines breaking on X.

This endpoint supports app-auth and user-auth authentication for OAuth1 and OAuth2 PKCE.

## Getting started

To use the endpoint, you need a [bearer token](/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) from the [developer portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard).

Once you have the bearer token, you can call the news API as shown below:

```bash
curl 'https://api.x.com/2/news/1989418137272422538?news.fields=contexts,cluster_posts_results' --header 'Authorization: Bearer XXXXX'
```

If the request is successful, you should see the JSON response as shown below:

```json

    "category":"News",

    "summary":"Nebius Group announced third-quarter revenue of $214 million, a fourfold increase year-over-year, alongside a $3 billion five-year GPU cloud services contract with Meta Platforms on November 11, 2025.
