The X API uses **pay-per-usage** pricing. No subscriptions, no monthly caps—pay only for what you use.

## Deduplication

All resources are deduplicated within a **24-hour UTC day window**. If you request and are charged for a resource (such as a Post), requesting the same resource again within that window will not incur an additional charge.

This means:
- Requesting the same Post multiple times in a day counts as one charge
- The deduplication window resets at midnight UTC
- This applies to all billable resources (Posts, users, etc.)

<Note>
Deduplication is a **soft guarantee**. While it occurs in the vast majority of cases, there may be specific edge cases like service outages that result in resources not being deduplicated.
</Note>

## Credit balance

Your credit balance is displayed in the Developer Console. Credits are deducted in real-time as you make API requests.

### Negative balance

Your credit balance can go slightly negative. If this happens, API requests will be blocked until you add credits to cover the negative balance.

<Warning>
Monitor your credit balance regularly to avoid service interruptions. Add credits before your balance reaches zero to ensure uninterrupted API access.
</Warning>

## Monitoring usage

Track your API usage programmatically with the [Usage endpoint](/x-api/usage/introduction):

```bash
curl "https://api.x.com/2/usage/tweets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN"
```

This returns daily Post consumption counts, helping you:
- Track consumption against your budget
- Set up alerts when approaching limits
- Identify high-consumption endpoints
- Generate usage reports
