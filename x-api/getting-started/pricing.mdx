import { Button } from '/snippets/button.mdx';

The X API uses **pay-per-usage** pricing. No subscriptions, no monthly caps—pay only for what you use.

</Tip>

<Note>
If you are on a legacy subscription package (Basic or Pro), you can opt in to Pay-per-use pricing directly from the [Developer Console](https://console.x.com). If you'd like to switch back to your legacy plan at any time, you can do so from the settings page within the Developer Console.

## Deduplication

All resources are deduplicated within a **24-hour UTC day window**. If you request and are charged for a resource (such as a Post), requesting the same resource again within that window will not incur an additional charge.

This means:
- Requesting the same Post multiple times in a day counts as one charge
- The deduplication window resets at midnight UTC
- This applies to all billable resources (Posts, users, etc.)

<Note>
Deduplication is a **soft guarantee**. While it occurs in the vast majority of cases, there may be specific edge cases like service outages that result in resources not being deduplicated.
</Note>

## Credit balance

Your credit balance is displayed in the Developer Console. Credits are deducted in real-time as you make API requests.

<Warning>
Monitor your credit balance regularly to avoid service interruptions. Add credits before your balance reaches zero to ensure uninterrupted API access.

_**Note:** It is possible for an account credit balance to go slightly negative. In this case, API requests will be blocked until you add credits to cover the negative balance._
</Warning>

### Auto-recharge

Enable auto-recharge to automatically top up your credit balance and avoid service interruptions. Configure this in the Developer Console:

| Setting | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Recharge amount** | The amount to add when auto-recharge triggers (e.g., $25) |
| **Trigger threshold** | Auto-recharge activates when your balance falls below this amount (e.g., $5) |

<Note>
Auto-recharge requires a saved payment method set as your default. You can cancel anytime in the Developer Console or by contacting support.
</Note>

---

### Spending limits

Set a maximum amount you can spend per billing cycle to control costs. When the limit is reached, API requests will be blocked until the next billing cycle.

| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Spending limit** | Set a specific dollar amount as your maximum spend per billing cycle |

<Tip>
Use spending limits to prevent unexpected charges, especially during development and testing.
</Tip>

## Free xAI API Credits

When you purchase X API credits, you can earn free [xAI API](https://docs.x.ai) credits based on your cumulative spend during a billing cycle.

<Note>
To receive free xAI credits, you must link your xAI team to your X developer account. You can do this by visiting your account settings in the [developer console](https://console.x.com).
</Note>

### How it works

Your cumulative spend is tracked throughout each billing cycle. As you cross spending thresholds, you unlock higher reward rates. When a new billing cycle starts, your cumulative spend resets to $0.

| Cumulative spend | Rate |
|:-----------------|:-----|
| &dollar;0 – &dollar;199 | 0% |
| &dollar;200 – &dollar;499 | 10% |
| &dollar;500 – &dollar;999 | 15% |
| &dollar;1,000+ | 20% |

<Note>
The rate applies to your **entire cumulative balance**, but you only receive the delta—what's newly owed minus what was already credited.
</Note>

### Example

Suppose you make several purchases throughout a billing cycle:

| Purchase | Rate | Total owed | Already credited | You receive |
|:---------|:-----|:-----------|:-----------------|:------------|
| &dollar;100 | 0% | &dollar;0 | &dollar;0 | **&dollar;0** |
| &dollar;100 | 10% | &dollar;20 | &dollar;0 | **&dollar;20** |
| &dollar;150 | 10% | &dollar;35 | &dollar;20 | **&dollar;15** |
| &dollar;150 | 15% | &dollar;75 | &dollar;35 | **&dollar;40** |
| &dollar;250 | 15% | &dollar;112.50 | &dollar;75 | **&dollar;37.50** |
| &dollar;250 | 20% | &dollar;200 | &dollar;112.50 | **&dollar;87.50** |
| | | | | |
| **&dollar;1,000** | | | | **&dollar;200** |

This is the same amount you'd receive from a single $1,000 purchase—the order and size of purchases doesn't affect your total rewards.

<Tip>
View your xAI credit balance and manage your account at [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai). For more details on xAI API billing, see the [xAI billing documentation](https://docs.x.ai/docs/key-information/billing).

## Monitoring usage

Track your API usage programmatically with the [Usage endpoint](/x-api/usage/introduction):

```bash
curl "https://api.x.com/2/usage/tweets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN"
```

This returns daily Post consumption counts, helping you:
- Track consumption against your budget
- Set up alerts when approaching limits
- Identify high-consumption endpoints
- Generate usage reports
