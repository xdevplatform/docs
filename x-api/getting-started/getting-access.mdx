Get started with the X API in three steps: sign up, create an app, and save your credentials.

<Button href="https://console.x.com">Sign up now</Button>

---

## Step 1: Create a developer account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Developer Console">
    Visit [console.x.com](https://console.x.com) and sign in with your X account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the Developer Agreement">
    Review and accept the Developer Agreement and Policy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete your profile">
    Provide basic information about how you'll use the API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 2: Create an app

After signing up, create an app to get your API credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'New App'">
    From the Developer Console dashboard, create a new app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter app details">
    Provide a name, description, and use case for your app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate credentials">
    The console will generate your API keys and tokens.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 3: Save your credentials

You'll receive several credentials depending on your authentication needs:

| Credential | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| **API Key & Secret** | Identify your app. Used to generate tokens and sign OAuth 1.0a requests. |
| **Bearer Token** | App-only authentication for reading public data. |
| **Access Token & Secret** | Make requests on behalf of your own account (OAuth 1.0a). |
| **Client ID & Secret** | OAuth 2.0 authentication for user-context requests. |

<Warning>
**Save immediately.** Credentials are only displayed once. Store them in a password manager or secure vault. If you lose them, you'll need to regenerate (which invalidates the old ones).
</Warning>

## Which credentials do you need?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Reading public data">
    Use the **Bearer Token** for simple, read-only access to public data.
    
    ```bash
    curl "https://api.x.com/2/users/by/username/xdevelopers" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN"
    ```
    
    Best for: Searching posts, looking up users, reading trends.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Acting as a user">
    Use **OAuth 2.0** (recommended) or **OAuth 1.0a** to act on behalf of users.
    
    OAuth 2.0 offers fine-grained scopes—request only the permissions you need.
    
    Best for: Posting, liking, following, accessing DMs.
    
    [OAuth 2.0 guide →](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/overview)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Acting as yourself">
    Use your **Access Token & Secret** to make requests as your own account.
    
    These tokens represent the account that owns the app.
    
    Best for: Testing, personal bots, your own automation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
