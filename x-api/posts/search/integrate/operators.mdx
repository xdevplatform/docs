## List of operators

<Note>**Note:** For some operators, an alternate name, or alias, is available.</Note>

| **Operator** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------------|
| `keyword` | Standalone | Matches a keyword within the body of a Post. This is a tokenized match, meaning that your keyword string will be matched against the tokenized text of the Post body. Tokenization splits words based on punctuation, symbols, and Unicode basic plane separator characters.<br/><br/>For example, a Post with the text “I like coca-cola” would be split into the following tokens: I, like, coca, cola. These tokens would then be compared to the keyword string used in your query. To match strings containing punctuation (for example coca-cola), symbol, or separator characters, you must wrap your keyword in double-quotes.<br/><br/>Example: `pepsi OR cola OR "coca cola"` |
| `emoji` | Standalone | Matches an emoji within the body of a Post. Similar to a keyword, emojis are a tokenized match, meaning that your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Post body.<br/><br/>Note that if an emoji has a variant, you must wrap it in double quotes to add to a query.<br/><br/>Example: `(😃 OR 😡) 😬` |
| `"exact phrase match"` | Standalone | Matches the exact phrase within the body of a Post.<br/><br/>Example: `("X API" OR #v2) -"recent search"` |
| `#` | Standalone | Matches any Post containing a recognized hashtag, if the hashtag is a recognized entity in a Post.<br/><br/>This operator performs an exact match, NOT a tokenized match, meaning the rule `#thanku` will match posts with the exact hashtag #thanku, but not those with the hashtag #thankunext.<br/><br/>Example: `#thankunext #fanart OR @arianagrande` |
| `@` | Standalone | Matches any Post that mentions the given username, if the username is a recognized entity (including the @ character).<br/><br/>Example: `(@XDevelopers OR @API) -@X` |
| `$` | Standalone | Matches any Post that contains the specified 'cashtag' (where the leading character of the token is the &dollar; character).<br/><br/>Note that the cashtag operator relies on X's 'symbols' entity extraction to match cashtags, rather than trying to extract the cashtag from the body itself.<br/><br/>Example: `$twtr OR @XDevelopers -$fb` |
| `from:` | Standalone | Matches any Post from a specific user.<br/>The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user’s numeric user ID.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single username/ID per `from:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `from:XDevelopers OR from:API -from:X` |
| `to:` | Standalone | Matches any Post that is in reply to a particular user.<br/>The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user’s numeric user ID.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single username/ID per `to:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `to:XDevelopers OR to:API -to:X` |
| `url:` | Standalone | Performs a tokenized match on any validly-formatted URL of a Post.<br/><br/>This operator matches on the contents of both the `url` or `expanded_url` fields. For example, a Post containing "You should check out X Developer Labs: https://t.co/c0A36SWil4" (with the short URL redirecting to https://developer.twitter.com) will match both the following rules:<br/><br/>`from:XDevelopers url:"https://developer.twitter.com"` (because it will match the contents of `entities.urls.expanded_url`)<br/><br/>`from:XDevelopers url:"https://t.co"` (because it will match the contents of `entities.urls.url`)<br/><br/>Tokens and phrases containing punctuation or special characters should be double-quoted (for example, `url:"/developer"`). Similarly, to match on a specific protocol, enclose in double-quotes (for example, `url:"https://developer.twitter.com"`). |
| `retweets_of:` | Standalone | Matches Posts that are Retweets of the specified user. The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user’s numeric user ID.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single username/ID per `retweets_of:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `retweets_of:twitterdev OR retweets_of:twitterapi` |
| `in_reply_to_tweet_id:` | Standalone | *Available alias:* `in_reply_to_status_id:`<br/>Matches on replies to the specified Post.<br/><br/>Example: `in_reply_to_tweet_id:1539382664746020864` |
| `retweets_of_tweet_id:` | Standalone | *Available alias:* `retweets_of_status_id:`<br/>Matches on explicit (or native) Retweets of the specified Post. Note that the Post ID used should be the ID of an original Post and not a Retweet.<br/><br/>Example: `retweets_of_tweet_id:1539382664746020864` |
| `quotes_of_tweet_id:` | Standalone | *Available alias:* `quotes_of_status_id:`<br/>Matches on Quote Tweets of the specified Post. Note that the Post ID used should be the ID of an original Post and not a Quote Tweet.<br/><br/>Example: `quotes_of_tweet_id:1539382664746020864` |
| `context:` | Standalone | Matches Posts with a specific domain id/entity id pair. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [annotations](/x-api/fundamentals/post-annotations).<br/><br/>You can only pass a single domain/entity per `context:` operator.<br/><br/>`context:domain_id.entity_id`<br/><br/>However, you can combine multiple domain/entities using the OR operator:<br/><br/>`(context:47.1139229372198469633 OR context:11.1088514520308342784)`<br/><br/>Examples:<br/>`context:10.799022225751871488` (`domain_id.entity_id` returns Posts matching that specific domain-entity pair) |
| `entity:` | Standalone | Matches Posts with a specific entity string value. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on [annotations](/x-api/fundamentals/post-annotations).<br/>**Please note** that this is only available with recent search.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single `entity:` operator.<br/><br/>`entity:"string declaration of entity/place"`<br/><br/>Examples: `entity:"Michael Jordan" OR entity:"Barcelona"` |
| `conversation_id:` | Standalone | Matches Posts that share a common conversation ID. A conversation ID is set to the Post ID of a Post that started a conversation. As Replies to a Post are posted, even Replies to Replies, the `conversation_id` is added to its JSON payload.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single conversation ID per `conversation_id:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `conversation_id:1334987486343299072 (from:XDevelopers OR from:api)` |
| `list:` | Standalone | Matches Posts posted by users who are members of a specified list.<br/><br/>For example, if @XDevelopers and @api were members of List 123, and you included `list:123` in your query, your response will only contain Posts that have been published by those accounts. You can find List IDs by using the [List lookup](/x-api/lists/list-lookup/introduction) endpoint.<br/><br/>**Please note** that you can only use a single `list:` operator per query, and you can only specify a single List per `list:` operator.<br/><br/>Example: `list:123` |
| `place:` | Standalone | Matches Posts tagged with the specified location or X place ID. Multi-word place names (“New York City”, “Palo Alto”) should be enclosed in quotes.<br/><br/>You can only pass a single place per `place:` operator.<br/><br/>Note: See the [GET geo/search](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-search) standard v1.1 endpoint for how to obtain X place IDs.<br/><br/>Note: This operator will not match on Retweets, since Retweet's places are attached to the original Post.
