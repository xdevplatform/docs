This page covers tools and key concepts for integrating the manage Posts endpoints into your system.

---

## Helpful tools

Before we dive into some key concepts that will help you integrate this endpoint, we recommend that you become familiar with:

### Postman

Postman is a great tool that you can use to test out an endpoint. Each Postman request includes every path and body parameter to help you quickly understand what is available to you. To learn more about our Postman collections, please visit our ["Using Postman"](/tutorials/postman-getting-started) page. 
 

### Code samples

Interested in getting set up with this endpoint with some code in your preferred coding language? We've got a handful of different code samples available that you can use as a starting point on our [Github page](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code).
 

### Third-party libraries

Take advantage of one of our communities' [third-party libraries](/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview) to help you get started. You can find a library that works with the v2 endpoints by looking for the proper version tag.
 

## Key concepts

### Authentication

All X API v2 endpoints require you to authenticate your requests with a set of credentials, also known as keys and tokens. 

These specific endpoints requires the use of [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication), which means that you must use a set of API keys and user Access Tokens to make a successful request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are making the request on behalf of. If you would like to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize or authenticate your App using the [3-legged OAuth flow](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow).

Please note that OAuth 1.0a can be difficult to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend that you use a [library](/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview), use a tool like Postman, or use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate your requests.

[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2) allows for greater control over an application's scope, and authorization flows across multiple devices. OAuth 2.0 allows you to pick specific fine-grained scopes which give you specific permissions on behalf of a user. 

To enable OAuth 2.0 in your App, you must enable it in your's App's authentication settings found in the App settings section of the Developer Console.

### Developer Console, Projects, and developer Apps

To retrieve a set of authentication credentials that will work with the X API v2 endpoints, you must have a [developer account]/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal), set up a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) within that account, and created a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) within that Project. You can then find your keys and tokens within your developer App. 
 

### Rate limits

Every day, many thousands of developers make requests to the X API. To help manage the sheer volume of these requests, [rate limits](https://developer.x.com/x-api/fundamentals/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that you can make on behalf of your app or on behalf of an authenticated user.

These endpoints are rate limited at the user level, meaning that the authenticated user that you are making the request on behalf of can only call the endpoint a certain number of times across any developer App. There is a user rate limit of 200 requests per 15 minutes for the POST method. The DELETE method has a rate limit of 50 requests for 15 minutes. Additionally, there is a limit of [300 requests per 3 hours](https://blog.x.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2018/new-developer-requirements-to-protect-our-platform), including Posts created with either manage Posts or manage Retweets.
 

### Source labels

Your App name and website URL will be shown as the [source label](https://help.x.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-tweet#source-labels) within metadata for any Posts created programmatically by your application. If you change the use case of a X App, be sure to update the use case in these settings in order to ensure you are in compliance with the [Developer Terms](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy).
 

### Profile settings

You can only add a location to Posts if you have geo enabled in your profile settings. If you don't have geo enabled, you can still add a location parameter in your request body, but it won't get attached to your Post. The same is also true for tagging users in images. If the user you're tagging doesn't have photo-tagging enabled, their names won't show up in the list of tagged users even though the Post is successfully created. 
 

### Adding media to a Post

Currently, isn't a way to fully upload media using v2 of the X API currently. However, you attach previously uploaded media to a Post. You can use media IDs that have been already [uploaded using the v1 media endpoint](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/media/upload-media/api-reference/post-media-upload) or [X Media Studio](https://media.x.com/en/articles/products/2018/media-studio). These media ids must be your own or that of an authenticated user.

## Code examples

### Create a Post

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.x.com/2/tweets" \
  -H "Authorization: OAuth ..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world!"}'
```

```python Python SDK
from xdk import Client
from xdk.oauth1_auth import OAuth1

oauth1 = OAuth1(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_secret="YOUR_API_SECRET",
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    access_token_secret="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"
)

client = Client(auth=oauth1)

# Create a Post
response = client.posts.create(text="Hello world!")
print(f"Created Post: {response.data.id}")
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK
import { Client, OAuth1 } from "@xdevplatform/xdk";

const oauth1 = new OAuth1({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  apiSecret: "YOUR_API_SECRET",
  accessToken: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
  accessTokenSecret: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET",
});

const client = new Client({ oauth1 });

// Create a Post
const response = await client.posts.create({ text: "Hello world!" });
console.log(`Created Post: ${response.data?.id}`);
