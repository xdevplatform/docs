This page contains information on several tools and critical concepts that you should know as you integrate the manage Bookmarks endpoints into your system. We've broken the page into a couple of different sections:

* [Helpful tools](/x-api/users/blocks/integrate#helpful-tools)
* Key Concepts
    * [Authentication](/x-api/users/blocks/integrate#authentication)
    * [Developer Console, Projects, and Apps](/x-api/users/blocks/integrate#Developer Console-projects-and-developer-apps)
    * [Rate limits](/x-api/users/blocks/integrate#rate-limits)

### Helpful tools

Before we dive into some key concepts that will help you integrate this endpoint, we recommend that you become familiar with:

#### Postman

Postman is a great tool that you can use to test out an endpoint. Each Postman request includes every path and body parameter to help you quickly understand what is available to you. To learn more about our Postman collections, please visit our ["Using Postman"](/tutorials/postman-getting-started) page. 

#### Code samples

Are you interested in getting set up with this endpoint with some code in your preferred coding language? We've got a handful of different code samples available that you can use as a starting point on our [Github page](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code).

#### Third-party libraries

Take advantage of one of our communities' [third-party libraries](/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview) to help you get started. You can find a library that works with the v2 endpoints by looking for the proper version tag.

### Key concepts

#### Authentication

All X API v2 endpoints require you to authenticate your requests with a set of credentials, also known as keys and tokens. 

These specific endpoints require the use of [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/authorization-code), which means that you must use a set of keys and user Access Tokens to make a successful request. The Access Tokens must be associated with the user that you are requesting on behalf of. If you want to generate a set of Access Tokens for another user, they must authorize or authenticate your App using an [Authorize URL](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#authorize-url).

Please note that OAuth 2.0 can be tricky to use. If you are not familiar with this authentication method, we recommend using a [library](/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview) or a tool like Postman to properly authenticate your requests.

#### Developer Console, Projects, and developer Apps

To retrieve a set of authentication credentials that will work with the X API v2 endpoints, you must have a [developer account](/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal), set up a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) within that account, and created a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) within that Project. You can then find your keys and tokens within your developer App. 

#### Rate limits

Every day, many thousands of developers make requests to the X API. To help manage the sheer volume of these requests, [rate limits](/resources/fundamentals/rate-limits) are placed on each endpoint that limits the number of requests that you can make on behalf of your app or on behalf of an authenticated user. 

These endpoints are rate limited at the user level, meaning that the authenticated user that you are making the request on behalf of can only call the endpoint a certain number of times across any developer App. There is a user rate limit of 180 requests per 15 min window for the GET method. With the GET method of the Bookmarks lookup endpoint you will get back 800 of your most recent Bookmarked Posts. Additionally, there is a user rate limit of 50 requests per 15 minutes for the POST and DELETE methods.

### Code examples

#### Get bookmarks

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```bash cURL
curl "https://api.x.com/2/users/123/bookmarks?tweet.fields=created_at,public_metrics" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```python Python SDK
from xdk import Client

client = Client(bearer_token="YOUR_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN")

# Get user's bookmarks
for page in client.bookmarks.get(user_id="123", tweet_fields=["created_at", "public_metrics"]):
    for post in page.data:
        print(f"{post.text} - Likes: {post.public_metrics.like_count}")
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK
import { Client } from "@xdevplatform/xdk";

const client = new Client({ accessToken: "YOUR_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN" });

// Get user's bookmarks
const paginator = client.bookmarks.get("123", {
  tweetFields: ["created_at", "public_metrics"],
});

for await (const page of paginator) {
  page.data?.forEach((post) => {
    console.log(`${post.text} - Likes: ${post.public_metrics?.like_count}`);
  });
}
```

#### Create a bookmark

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.x.com/2/users/123/bookmarks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_ACCESS_TOKEN" \

  -d '{"tweet_id": "1234567890"}'
```

```python Python SDK
from xdk import Client

client = Client(bearer_token="YOUR_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN")

# Bookmark a Post
response = client.bookmarks.create(user_id="123", tweet_id="1234567890")
print(response.data)
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK
import { Client } from "@xdevplatform/xdk";

const client = new Client({ accessToken: "YOUR_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN" });

// Bookmark a Post
const response = await client.bookmarks.create("123", { tweetId: "1234567890" });
console.log(response.data);
```
