## Getting started with the Quote Tweets lookup endpoint

This quick start guide will help you make your first request to the Quote Tweets lookup endpoints with a set of specified fields using [Postman](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/tutorials/postman-getting-started).

If you would like to see sample code in different languages, please visit our [X API v2 sample code](https://github.com/xdevplatform/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code) GitHub repository. 

#### Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need to have a set of [keys and tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) to authenticate your request. You can generate these keys and tokens by following these steps:

* [Sign up for a developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/apply-for-access) and receive approval.
* Create a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) and an associated [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) in the developer portal.
* Navigate to your App's “Keys and tokens” page to generate the required credentials. Make sure to save all credentials in a secure location.

**Steps to build a Quote Tweets lookup request**

**Step one: Start with a tool or library**

There are several different tools, code examples, and libraries that you can use to make a request to this endpoint, but we are going to use the Postman tool here to simplify the process.

To load X API v2 Postman collection into your environment, please click on the following button:

<Button href="https://t.co/twitter-api-postman">
  Add X API v2 to Postman
</Button>

Once you have the X API v2 collection loaded in Postman, navigate to the timeline folder and find the "Quote Tweets by ID" request.

**Step two: Authenticate your request**

To properly make a request to the X API, you need to verify that you have permission. To do so with this endpoint, you must authenticate your request with either [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#app-only-authentication-and-oauth-2-0-bearer-token), [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE](resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce-2), or [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) authentication methods.

For simplicity's sake, we will utilize OAuth 2.0 App-Only with this request, but you will need to use one of the other authentication methods if you'd like to request private [metrics](/x-api/fundamentals/metrics) or Posts. 

You must add your keys and tokens, specifically the [App Access Token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#using-and-generating-an-app-only-bearer-token) (also known as the App-only Bearer Token) to Postman. You can do this by selecting the environment named “X API v2” in the top-right corner of Postman and adding your keys and tokens to the "initial value" and "current value" fields (by clicking the eye icon next to the environment dropdown).

This variable will automatically be pulled into the request's authorization tab if you've done this correctly.

**Step three: Identify and specify the Post you would like to retrieve the Quote Tweets for**

You must specify a Post you would like to retrieve Quote Tweets for within the request by passing the  Post ID.

In this example, the Post ID that we will use is 1409931481552543749.

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and enter this Post ID into the "Value" column of the id parameter.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| `id` | 1409931481552543749 |

**Step four: Identify and specify which fields you would like to retrieve**

If you click the "Send" button after step three, you will receive the default [Post object](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#tweet) fields in your response: id,  text, and edit\_history\_tweet_ids.

If you would like to receive additional fields, you will have to specify those fields in your request with the [field](/x-api/fundamentals/fields) and/or [expansion](/x-api/fundamentals/expansions) parameters.

For this exercise, we will request three additional different sets of fields from different objects:

1.  The additional tweet.created_at field in the primary user objects.

2.  The associated authors’ user object’s default fields for the returned Posts: id, name, and username
3.  The additional user.created_at field in the associated user objects.
     

In Postman, navigate to the "Params" tab and add the following key:value pair to the "Query Params" table:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Value** | **Returned fields** |
| `tweet.fields` | `created_at` | `tweets.created_at` |
| `expansions` | `author_id` | `includes.users.id`, `includes.users.name`, `includes.users.username` |
| `user.fields` | `created_at` | `includes.users.created_at` |     |

You should now see the following URL next to the "Send" button:

      `https://api.x.com/2/tweets/:id/quote_tweets?expansions=author_id&tweet.fields=created_at&user.fields=created_at`


**Please note:**

In Postman, the path parameter :id in the URL field will **not** automatically update to the value that you enter into the `id` params field, which is why the above URL includes `:id` and not 1409931481552543749.

**Step five: Make your request and review your response**

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Send" button and you will receive the following response:

```

#### Step six: Paginate through your results

In the previous response, you will find a meta data object at the bottom that includes the following fields:

* results_count
* next_token

In step four, because we did not specify a max_results parameter, we will only get 10 Posts by default. To access the additional pages of data, we will be taking the value of the next_token field from our last results and adding that string as the value of the pagination_token parameter on the Postman params page, keeping everything else constant. 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Value** |
| `pagination_token` | avdjwk0udyx6 |

Once this is all set up, you can click "Send" again and you should receive the next page of results. 

We have put together a guide on [pagination](/x-api/fundamentals/pagination) to further explain this concept.
