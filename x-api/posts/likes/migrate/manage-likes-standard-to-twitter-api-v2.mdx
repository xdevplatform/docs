### Manage Likes: Standard v1.1 compared to X API v2

If you have been working with the standard v1.1 [POST favorites/create](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-favorites-create) and [POST favorites/destroy](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/post-favorites-destroy) endpoints, the goal of this guide is to help you understand the similarities and differences between the standard v1.1 and X API v2 manage Likes endpoints.

* **Similarities**
    * OAuth 1.0a User Context
* **Differences**
    * Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
    * App and Project requirements
    * Request parameters

#### Similarities

**OAuth 1.0a User Context authentication method**

Both the endpoint versions support [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-1-0a-2). Therefore, if you were previously using one of the standard v1.1 manage favorites endpoints, you can continue using the same authentication method if you migrate to the X API v2 version.

#### Differences

**Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods**

* Standard v1.1 endpoints:
    * POST https://api.x.com/1.1/favorites/create.json
        (like a Post)
    * POST https://api.x.com/1.1/favorites/destroy.json
        (unlike a Post)
* X API v2 endpoint:
    * POST https://api.x.com/2/tweets/:id/likes
        (like a Post)
    * DELETE https://api.x.com/2/tweets/:id/likes/:tweet_id
        (unlike a Post) 

**App and Project requirements**

The X API v2 endpoints require that you use credentials from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is associated to a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) when authenticating your requests. All X API v1.1 endpoints can use credentials from standalone Apps or Apps associated with a Project.


**Request parameters**

The following standard v1.1 request parameters have equivalents in X API v2:

| Standard v1.1 | X API v2 |
| :--- | :--- |
| id  | id  |
| includes_entities | No equivalent |

Please note that the Standard v1.1 parameters are passed as query parameters, whereas the X API v2 parameters are passed as body parameters for the POST endpoint or path parameters for the DELETE endpoint.

Also, an id of the user liking a Post is not required when using the standard v1.1 endpoints since the [Access Tokens](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#obtaining-access-tokens-using-3-legged-oauth-flow) passed with [OAuth 1.0a User Context](/resources/fundamentals/authentication) infer which user is initiating the like/unlike.
