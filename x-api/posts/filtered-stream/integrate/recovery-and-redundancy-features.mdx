#### Introduction

When consuming realtime data, maximizing your connection time and receiving all matched data is a fundamental goal. This means that it is important to take advantage of redundant connections, automatically detect disconnections, to reconnect quickly, and to have a plan for recovering lost data.

In this integration guide, we will discuss different recovery and redundancy features: redundant connections, backfill, and recovery.
 

**Redundant connections**

A redundant connection simply allows you to establish more than one simultaneous connections to the filtered stream. This provides redundancy by allowing you to connect to the same stream with two separate consumers, receiving the same data through both connections. Thus, your app has a hot failover for various situations such as if one stream is disconnected or if your application's primary server fails.

Filtered stream currently only allows Projects with Enterprise access to connect to up to two redundant connections. To use a redundant stream, simply connect to the same URL used for your primary connection. The data for your stream will be sent through both connections.

#### Recovering missed data after a disconnection: Backfill

After you've detected a disconnection, your system should be smart enough to reconnect to the stream. If possible, your system should take note of how long the disconnection lasted so that you can use the proper recovery feature to backfill the data. 

If you are using a Project with Enterprise access and identified that the disconnection lasted five minutes or less, you can use the backfill parameter, backfill_minutes. If you pass this parameter with your [GET /tweets/search/stream](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream#get-2-tweets-search-stream) request, you will receive the Posts that match your rules within the past one to five minutes. We generally deliver these older Posts first before any newly matched Posts, and also do not deduplicate Posts. This means that if you were disconnected for 90 seconds, but request two minutes worth of backfill data, you will receive 30 seconds worth of duplicate Posts, which your system should be tolerant of. Here is an example of what a request might look like with the backfill parameter:

      `curl 'https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/stream?backfill_minutes=5' -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"`


If you don't have Enterprise access, or identified that the disconnection time lasted for longer than five minutes, you can utilize the [recent search endpoint](/x-api/posts/search/introduction) or the recovery feature to request missed data. However, note that the search Posts endpoints do not include the sample:, bio:, bio_name:, or bio_location: operators, and has certain differences in matching behavior when using accents and diacritics with the keyword and #hashtag operators. These differences could mean that you don't fully recover all Posts that might have been received via the filtered stream endpoints. 

**Recovering missed data after a disconnection: Recovery**

If you are using a Project with Enterprise access, you can use the Recovery feature to recover missed data within the last 24 hours if you are unable to reconnect with the 5 minute backfill window.

The streaming recovery feature allows you to have an extended backfill window of 24 hours. Recovery enables you to 'replay' the time period of missed data. A recovery stream is started when you make a connection request using 'start\_time' and 'end\_time' request parameters. Once connected, Recovery will re-stream the time period indicated, then disconnect.  

You will be able to make 2 concurrent requests to recovery at the same time, i.e. “two recovery jobs”. Recovery works technically in the same way as backfill, except a start and end time is defined. A recovery period is for a single time range.
