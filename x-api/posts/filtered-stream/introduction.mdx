The Filtered Stream endpoints let you receive real-time Posts that match your filter rules. Create rules using powerful operators, then connect to a persistent stream to receive matching Posts as they're published.

## Overview

## How it works

1. **Create rules** — Define filter rules using operators
2. **Connect to stream** — Establish a persistent HTTP connection
3. **Receive Posts** — Get matching Posts in real-time

## Building rules

Rules use the same operators as search queries:

```
(AI OR "machine learning") lang:en -is:retweet
```

### Example rules

| Rule | Matches |
|:-----|:--------|
| `#python` | Posts with #python hashtag |
| `from:elonmusk` | Posts by @elonmusk |
| `"breaking news" has:images` | Posts with phrase and images |
| `(@XDevelopers OR @X) -is:retweet` | Mentions, excluding retweets |

## Connecting to the stream

Establish a persistent HTTP connection to receive Posts:

```python
import requests

def stream_posts(bearer_token):
    url = "https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/stream"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {bearer_token}"}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, stream=True)
    
    for line in response.iter_lines():
        if line:
            print(line.decode("utf-8"))
```

### Keep-alive signals

The stream sends blank lines (`\r\n`) every 20 seconds to maintain the connection. If you don't receive data or a keep-alive for 20 seconds, reconnect.

## Webhook delivery

Instead of maintaining a persistent connection, you can receive Posts via webhooks:

## Post edits

The stream delivers edited Posts with their edit history. Each edit creates a new Post ID:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1234567893",
    "text": "Hello world! (edited)",
    "edit_history_tweet_ids": ["1234567890", "1234567891", "1234567893"]
  }
}
```
