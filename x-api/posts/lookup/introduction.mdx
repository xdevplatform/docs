The Post is one of the primary resources on X. In its simplest form, a Post can contain up to 280 characters and can be posted either publicly or privately, depending on an accountâ€™s settings. However, a variety of different objects can also be attached to Post, including media, a place, polls, and URLs. In addition, most Posts can be edited for up to 30 minutes after being created.

While there are a variety of HTTP, selection, and delivery methods for Posts, this group of REST endpoints focuses on returning a Post or group of Posts, specified by a [Post ID](/resources/fundamentals/x-ids). These endpoints can receive up-to-date details on a Post, verify that a Post is available, and examine its edit history. They are also crucial for managing [compliance events](/x-api/enterprise-gnip-2.0/fundamentals/firehouse).

The Post lookup endpoint provides edited Post metadata. All Posts created since September 29, 2022, include edit metadata, even if they were never edited. Each edit results in a new Post ID, with a Post's edit history represented by an array of Post IDs, beginning with the original.

This endpoint will always return the most recent edit along with its edit history. Any Post collected after its 30-minute edit window has expired will represent its final version. To learn more about Edit Post metadata, check out the [Edit Posts fundamentals](/x-api/fundamentals/edit-posts) page.

These endpoints use the GET HTTP method and return one or many [Posts objects](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary), which include fields such as the Post text, creation timestamp, and lists and metadata of hashtags, mentions, and photos.
