The Post lookup endpoints allow you to retrieve one or more Posts by their IDs. Use these endpoints to get up-to-date Post details, verify Post availability, or examine edit history.

## Overview

Posts are the core content on X. Each Post can contain:
- Up to 280 characters of text
- Attached media (images, videos, GIFs)
- Polls, places, and URLs
- Replies, quotes, and mentions

Posts can be edited up to 5 times within 30 minutes of creation. Each edit generates a new Post ID, and the edit history is preserved.
