The Usage endpoint lets you monitor your API usage, including the number of Posts consumed. Track your usage programmatically to manage costs and stay within limits.

<Note>
Pay-per-usage plans are subject to a monthly cap of 2 million Post reads. If you need higher volume, consider an [Enterprise plan](/forms/enterprise-api-interest).
