<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a job" icon="plus">
    Create a new compliance job specifying the type (tweets or users):

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.x.com/2/compliance/jobs" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "type": "tweets",
        "name": "my-compliance-job"
      }'
    ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    bearer_token = "YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"

    url = "https://api.x.com/2/compliance/jobs"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {bearer_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "type": "tweets",
        "name": "my-compliance-job"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print(response.json())
    ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    **Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "id": "1234567890",
        "type": "tweets",
        "name": "my-compliance-job",
        "status": "created",
        "upload_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/...",
        "download_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/...",
        "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z"
      }
    }
    ```

    Save the `upload_url` and `download_url` for the next steps.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare your data file" icon="file">
    Create a text file with one ID per line:

    ```
    1234567890
    1234567891
    1234567892
    1234567893
    ```

    Save as `ids.txt`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload your data" icon="upload">
    Upload the file to the provided `upload_url`:

    ```bash
    curl -X PUT "UPLOAD_URL_FROM_RESPONSE" \
      -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
      --data-binary @ids.txt
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check job status" icon="clock">
    Poll the job status until it's complete:

    ```bash
    curl "https://api.x.com/2/compliance/jobs/1234567890" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN"
    ```

    **Job statuses:**

    | Status | Description |
    |:-------|:------------|
    | `created` | Job created, awaiting upload |
    | `in_progress` | Processing data |
    | `complete` | Results ready for download |
    | `failed` | Job failed |
    | `expired` | Job expired before completion |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download results" icon="download">
    Once status is `complete`, download from the `download_url`:

    ```bash
    curl "DOWNLOAD_URL_FROM_RESPONSE" -o results.json
    ```

    **Result format** (one JSON object per line):

    ```json
    {"id": "1234567890", "action": "delete", "created_at": "2024-01-10T12:00:00.000Z", "redacted_at": "2024-01-12T08:30:00.000Z", "reason": "deleted"}
    {"id": "1234567891", "action": "delete", "created_at": "2024-01-10T12:00:00.000Z", "redacted_at": "2024-01-13T14:20:00.000Z", "reason": "suspended"}
    ```

    Only IDs with compliance events appear in the results. IDs not in the results are still valid.
  </Step>
</Steps>
