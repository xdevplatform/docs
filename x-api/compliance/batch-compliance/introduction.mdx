The Batch Compliance endpoints let you upload datasets of Post IDs or user IDs and receive their current compliance status. Use this to identify deleted Posts, suspended accounts, and other compliance events.

## How it works

1. **Create a job** — Specify the type (Posts or users) and upload URL
2. **Upload IDs** — Upload your dataset to the provided URL
3. **Wait for processing** — Job processes asynchronously
4. **Download results** — Get compliance status for each ID
