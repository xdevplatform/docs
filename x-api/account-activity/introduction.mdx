The Account Activity API delivers real-time account activity events to your webhook. Subscribe to user accounts and receive notifications when they post, receive DMs, get followed, and more.

## How it works

1. **Register webhook** — Register your webhook URL
2. **Subscribe users** — Add user subscriptions
3. **Receive events** — Get activity events via POST requests
4. **Process events** — Handle events in your application

---

## Event types

| Category | Events |
|:---------|:-------|
| **Posts** | Create, delete, favorite, unfavorite |
| **Direct Messages** | Received, sent, typing indicator |
| **Follows** | Follow, unfollow |
| **Blocks** | Block, unblock |
| **Mutes** | Mute, unmute |

## Webhook security

All webhook requests include:
- **CRC validation** — Verify webhook authenticity
- **Signature header** — `x-twitter-webhooks-signature`
- **HTTPS required** — All webhook URLs must use HTTPS

---

## Example: Register a webhook

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.x.com/1.1/account_activity/all/env-name/webhooks.json?\
url=https%3A%2F%2Fyour-server.com%2Fwebhook" \
  -H "Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key=..."
```
