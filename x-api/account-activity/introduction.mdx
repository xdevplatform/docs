The Account Activity API (AAA) provides a way to receive real-time events related to X user accounts via webhooks. By subscribing specific user accounts to a pre-configured webhook, your application can be notified of various activities such as Posts, Direct Messages, Likes, Follows, Blocks, and more, from one or more of your owned or subscribed accounts through a single connection.

This API is commonly used to build applications that need to react instantly to user actions or maintain an up-to-date state based on user activity.

## How it works

1. **Register webhook** — Register your webhook URL via the [V2 Webhooks API](/x-api/webhooks/introduction)
2. **Subscribe users** — Add user subscriptions to your webhook
3. **Receive events** — Get activity events delivered as POST requests with JSON payloads
4. **Process events** — Handle events in your application and respond with `200 OK`

---

## Activity types

You will receive all related activities below for each user subscription on your webhook registration:

- **Posts** (by user)
- **Post deletes** (by user)
- **@mentions** (of user)
- **Replies** (to or from user)
- **Reposts** (by user or of user)
- **Quote Posts** (by user or of user)
- **Reposts of Quoted Posts** (by user or of user)
- **Likes** (by user or of user)
- **Follows** (by user or of user)
- **Unfollows** (by user or of user)
- **Blocks** (by user or of user)
- **Unblocks** (by user or of user)
- **Mutes** (by user or of user)
- **Unmutes** (by user or of user)
- **Direct Messages sent** (by user)
- **Direct Messages received** (by user)
- **Typing indicators** (to user)
- **Read receipts** (to user)
- **Subscription revokes** (by user)

<Note>
We do not deliver home timeline data via the Account Activity API. Use the [User Posts timeline by User ID](/x-api/posts/timelines/get-user-tweets) endpoint to pull this data.

The returned Posts from the Account Activity API count towards the monthly [Post cap](/x-api/fundamentals/post-cap).

## Support for longform Posts

The V2 Account Activity API supports **longform** posts, which are posts exceeding 280 characters. When a longform post is included in a `tweet_create_events` payload, the `text` field contains the first 140 characters (or fewer), and the `truncated` field is set to `true`. The full post content is delivered in the `extended_tweet` object, which includes:

- `full_text` — The complete text of the post, including all characters beyond the 280-character limit.
- `entities` — Any entities (e.g., hashtags, URLs, user mentions, symbols) appearing in the full text, including those after the 280th character.
- `display_text_range` — The range of characters to display, accounting for the full text.

This ensures that applications can process the entire content of longform posts, including mentions or other entities that appear later in the text. Below is an example of a `tweet_create_events` payload for a longform post:

```json

  "for_user_id": "1603419180975409153",

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the advantages of using the Account Activity API?">
    The Account Activity API uses webhooks, delivering data in real-time without requiring an open connection (unlike streaming APIs) or frequent polling (unlike REST APIs). Benefits include:

    - **Speed** — Delivers data at the speed of X.
    - **Simplicity** — Provides all account events through a single webhook connection, including Posts, @mentions, Replies, Reposts, Quote Tweets, Likes, DMs, Follows, Blocks, and Mutes.
    - **Scale** — Supports all activities for managed accounts without rate limits or event caps (Enterprise tier).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I need development, staging, and production environments. Is this possible?">
    Yes! You can register multiple webhook URLs and manage subscriptions separately via the [V2 Webhooks API](/x-api/webhooks/introduction).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you have any step-by-step guides for getting set up?">
    Yes! See the [Account Activity API Quickstart](/x-api/account-activity/quickstart), the [Getting Started with Webhooks guide](/x-api/webhooks/quickstart), and the [Account Activity API Sample Application](https://github.com/xdevplatform/account-activity-dashboard-enterprise/tree/master).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What authentication do I need for the Account Activity API?">
    Authentication requirements vary by endpoint:

    - **User-specific actions** (e.g., subscribing a user) require **OAuth 1.0a** (3-legged OAuth flow).
    - **App-level actions** (e.g., listing/deleting subscriptions, subscription count) require **OAuth2 App Only Bearer Token**.

    Review the [Authentication section](/fundamentals/authentication/overview) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will I get duplicate activities if subscribed to users interacting with each other?">
    Yes. If your app has subscriptions for User A and User B, and User A mentions User B in a Post, your webhook receives two events (one per user). Use the `for_user_id` field to identify the subscription.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I replace /all/ in the endpoint to limit activities delivered?">
    No. The `/all/` product is the only option, delivering all supported event types.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="If I have access to three webhooks, can I use three webhooks for each of my apps?">
    The webhook limit is set at the account level, not per app. For example, with three webhooks and two apps, you could use two webhooks for one app and one for the other, but not three per app.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
