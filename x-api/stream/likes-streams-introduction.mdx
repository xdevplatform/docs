The Likes Streams endpoints deliver real-time like events through persistent HTTP GET connections. These streams provide access to like activity across X, enabling you to track engagement patterns, monitor content performance, and analyze liking behavior at scale.

Two streams are available:

* **All Likes stream** — Delivers all public like events in real time (firehose).
* **Sampled Likes stream** — Delivers a 10% sample of public like events.

These streaming endpoints use [OAuth 2.0 App-Only](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#oauth-2-0) authentication.

_To use these APIs, you must first set up an account with our enterprise sales team._

<Note>
**Account setup**

To access these endpoints, you will need:

* An approved [developer account](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info).
* To authenticate using the keys and tokens from a [developer App](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) that is located within a [Project](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps).

Learn more about getting access to the X API v2 endpoints in our [getting started guide](/x-api/getting-started/getting-access).
