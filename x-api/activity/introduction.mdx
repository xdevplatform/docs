## How it works

1. **Create subscription** — Subscribe to a user's activity
2. **Connect to stream** — Establish persistent connection
3. **Receive events** — Get real-time activity events
4. **Process events** — Handle events in your application

---

## Example: Connect to stream

```python
import requests

def stream_activity(bearer_token):
    url = "https://api.x.com/2/activity/stream"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {bearer_token}"}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, stream=True)
    
    for line in response.iter_lines():
        if line:
            print(line.decode("utf-8"))
```
