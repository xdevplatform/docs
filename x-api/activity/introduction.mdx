The X Activity API (XAA) endpoint group allows developers to tap in to activity events happening on the X Platform.

A developer can subscribe to events they are interested in such as `profile.update.bio`, `profile.update.profile_picture` etc. and filter for the User ID whose events they want. The matching events for that User ID will be delivered to your app with sub-second latency.

<Warning>
The X Activity API is available as an open beta. While in open beta, please expect potential bugs, breaking changes, or incomplete features.

Your feedback is invaluable—report issues via our [developer community forums](https://devcommunity.x.com/).
</Warning>

## Delivery Mechanisms

The X Activity API currently supports the following delivery mechanisms to send events to your app:

- Persistent HTTP stream
- [Webhook](/x-api/webhooks/introduction)

</Note>

## Event Privacy and Authentication

The X Activity API distinguishes between **public events** and **private events** as at parity with the X app as explained below.

### Public Events

Public events are activities that a public user account perform publicly that are visible to all X users. These events are visible to all users on the X platform and don't require OAuth authentication from the user in order to view.

**Current public events:**
- Profile updates (bio, picture, banner, location, URL, username changes)

For these public events, you can create subscriptions by specifying the user ID in your filter and receive them via XAA.

### Private Events

Private events are activities that require explicit user consent through OAuth authentication. A User has to authenticate via X and give explicit permission to a developer app to access these events. 

**Authentication requirements for private events:**
- The user must authenticate your application via OAuth 2.0
- Your application must obtain appropriate OAuth scopes
- The user must explicitly grant permission for your app to access these events
- Subscriptions for private events can only be created for users who have authorized your application

## Subscription Limits

The X Activity API has different subscription limits based on your account tier:

| Package Tier | Maximum Subscriptions |
| --- | --- |
| Self-serve | 1000 |
| Enterprise | 50,000 |
| Partner | 100,000 |
