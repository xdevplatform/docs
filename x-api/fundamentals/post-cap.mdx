X API v2 uses **pay-per-usage** pricing. You're charged based on actual API consumption, tracked at the app level.

## How billing works

| Concept | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Credit-based** | Purchase credits upfront, deducted as you use the API |
| **Per-request pricing** | Different endpoints have different costs |
| **Real-time tracking** | Monitor usage in the Developer Console |
| **No caps** | Use as much as you need—no monthly limits |

---

## Tracked endpoints

Posts retrieved from these endpoints count toward usage:

| Category | Endpoints |
|:---------|:----------|
| **Post lookup** | [GET /2/tweets](/x-api/posts/lookup/introduction) |
| **Search** | [Recent search](/x-api/posts/search/introduction), [Full-archive search](/x-api/posts/search/introduction) |
| **Streaming** | [Filtered stream](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream/introduction), [Filtered stream webhooks](/x-api/webhooks/stream/introduction) |
| **Timelines** | [User posts](/x-api/posts/timelines/introduction), [User mentions](/x-api/posts/timelines/introduction) |
| **Engagement** | [Liked posts](/x-api/posts/likes/introduction), [Bookmarks](/x-api/posts/bookmarks/introduction) |
| **Lists** | [List posts](/x-api/lists/list-tweets/introduction) |
| **Spaces** | [Spaces lookup](/x-api/spaces/lookup/introduction) |

---

## Deduplication

<Note>
**Daily deduplication**: If the same post is returned from multiple queries within a day, it only counts once for billing.
</Note>

This means:

- Retrieving the same post multiple times in one day = 1 charge
- Retrieving a post again the next day = 1 additional charge
- Different posts in the same request = each counts separately

---

## Monitoring usage

Track your usage in the [Developer Console](https://console.x.com):

| Metric | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Total usage** | Posts retrieved in the billing period |
| **By endpoint** | Breakdown by endpoint type |
| **By app** | Usage per developer app |
| **Cost tracking** | Real-time cost calculations |
| **Credit balance** | Remaining prepaid credits |

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is streaming billed?">
Each unique post delivered through filtered stream counts toward usage, subject to daily deduplication.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do failed requests count?">
