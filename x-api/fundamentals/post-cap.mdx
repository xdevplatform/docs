X API v2 has a Post consumption cap that limits the number of Posts that can be retrieved from specific endpoints on a monthly basis. Post caps apply at the [Project](/resources/fundamentals/projects) level, meaning that any requests to the endpoints listed below using the keys and tokens from [developer Apps](/resources/fundamentals/developer-apps) within that Project will count towards the Project Post cap.

## Limited v2 endpoints

Posts received from any of the following endpoints count towards this monthly Post cap:

- [Posts Lookup](/x-api/posts/lookup/introduction)
- [Recent search](/x-api/posts/counts/introduction)
- [Full-archive search](/x-api/posts/counts/introduction)
- [Filtered stream](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream)
- [User Post timeline](/x-api/posts/timelines)
- [User mention timeline](/x-api/posts/timelines)
- [Likes lookup - Posts liked by a user](/x-api/posts/likes)
- [Bookmarks lookup - Posts bookmarked by a user](/x-api/posts/bookmarks/introduction)
- [List Posts lookup](/x-api/lists/list-tweets/introduction)
- [Spaces Lookup](/x-api/spaces/lookup/introduction)

### Note

If the same Post is returned from multiple queries during a day, it only counts once against the Post cap; Posts are deduplicated daily.

## Post cap volumes

The Post cap volume varies based on your access level:

| Access Tier   | Monthly Post Cap                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------|
| **Free**      | 1,500 Posts per month           |
| **Basic**     | 10,000 Posts per month          |
| **Pro**       | 1,000,000 Posts per month       |
| **Enterprise**| 50+ million Posts per month     |

You can check your usage towards the monthly Post cap by viewing the [main dashboard page](https://developer.x.com/content/developer-twitter/en/portal/dashboard) in the [developer portal](/resources/fundamentals/developer-portal). Under the name of your Project, you’ll see a status bar that shows your current month’s usage in relation to the Post cap, including the total Posts pulled, the percentage of Posts used, and the reset date for your usage.
