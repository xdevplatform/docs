Posts on X can be edited within 30 minutes of posting, up to 5 times. The X API provides full access to edit history and metadata.

---

## Edit rules

| Rule | Details |
|:-----|:--------|
| **Time window** | 30 minutes from original post |
| **Edit limit** | 5 edits maximum |
| **ID behavior** | Each edit creates a new post ID |
| **Deletion** | Deleting any version deletes the entire chain |

---

## What can't be edited

Some post types are not editable:

- Promoted posts (ads)
- Posts with polls
- Replies to others (non-self-thread)
- Reposts (Quote posts *can* be edited)
- Community posts
- Collaborative posts
- Scheduled posts

---

## Edit data in responses

### Default fields

All post responses include `edit_history_tweet_ids` by default:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1234567891",
    "text": "Updated text (edited)",
    "edit_history_tweet_ids": ["1234567890", "1234567891"]
  }
}
```

- Single ID = never edited
- Multiple IDs = edit history (oldest first)

### Edit controls

Request `edit_controls` for edit status:

```bash
curl "https://api.x.com/2/tweets/1234567891?tweet.fields=edit_controls" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1234567891",
    "text": "Updated text (edited)",
    "edit_history_tweet_ids": ["1234567890", "1234567891"],
    "edit_controls": {
      "is_edit_eligible": true,
      "editable_until": "2024-01-15T12:30:00.000Z",
      "edits_remaining": 3
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `is_edit_eligible` | Whether the post can be edited |
| `editable_until` | Timestamp when edit window closes |
| `edits_remaining` | Number of edits left (0-5) |

---

## Getting edit history

Use the `edit_history_tweet_ids` expansion to get full post objects for all versions:

```bash
curl "https://api.x.com/2/tweets/1234567891?\
tweet.fields=edit_controls&\
expansions=edit_history_tweet_ids" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1234567891",
    "text": "Updated text (edited)",
    "edit_history_tweet_ids": ["1234567890", "1234567891"],
    "edit_controls": {
      "is_edit_eligible": true,
      "editable_until": "2024-01-15T12:30:00.000Z",
      "edits_remaining": 3
    }
  },
  "includes": {
    "tweets": [{
      "id": "1234567890",
      "text": "Original text (with typo)",
      "edit_history_tweet_ids": ["1234567890", "1234567891"],
      "edit_controls": {
        "is_edit_eligible": true,
        "editable_until": "2024-01-15T12:30:00.000Z",
        "edits_remaining": 3
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

## Which version is returned?

By default, the API returns the **most recent version** of an edited post.

To get a specific version, request it by its post ID directly:

```bash
# Get original version
curl "https://api.x.com/2/tweets/1234567890" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get edited version  
curl "https://api.x.com/2/tweets/1234567891" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

## Metrics for edited posts

Each version of an edited post has its own engagement metrics. The metrics are attributed to the version that was visible when the engagement occurred.

---

## Availability

Edit metadata is available:

- For all posts created since September 29, 2022
- On all v2 endpoints that return posts
- Including search, timelines, stream, and lookup

Posts created before this date do not have edit metadata.

---
