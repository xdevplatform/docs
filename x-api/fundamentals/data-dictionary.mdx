## Post (Tweet)

Posts are the core content unit on X. Each Post object includes text, metadata, and references to related objects like authors, media, and polls.

**Default fields:** `id`, `text`, `edit_history_tweet_ids`

Use `tweet.fields` to request additional fields and `expansions` to include related objects.

### User

The user object contains Twitter user account metadata describing the referenced user. The user object is the primary object returned in the [users lookup](/x-api/users/lookup/introduction) endpoint. When requesting additional user fields on this endpoint, simply use the fields parameter `user.fields`.

The user object can also be found as a child object and expanded in the Tweet object. The object is available for expansion with `?expansions=author_id` or `?expansions=in_reply_to_user_id` to get the condensed object with only default fields. Use the expansion with the field parameter: `user.fields` when requesting additional fields to complete the object.

### Space

Spaces allow expression and interaction via live audio conversations. The Space data dictionary contains relevant metadata about a Space; all the details are updated in real time.

User objects can be found and expanded in the user resource. These objects are available for expansion by adding at least one of `host_ids`, `creator_id`, `speaker_ids`, `mentioned_user_ids` to the `expansions` query parameter.

Unlike Tweets, Spaces are ephemeral and become unavailable after they end or when they are canceled by their creator. When your app handles Spaces data, you are responsible for returning the most up-to-date information and must remove data that is no longer available from the platform. The [Spaces lookup endpoints](/x-api/spaces/lookup/introduction) can help you ensure you respect the users’ expectations and intent.

### List

The list object contains [Twitter Lists](https://help.x.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists) metadata describing the referenced List. The List object is the primary object returned in the List lookup endpoint. When requesting additional List fields on this endpoint, simply use the fields parameter `list.fields`.

The List object is not found as a child of other data objects. However, user objects can be found and expanded in the user resource. These objects are available for expansion by adding `owner_id` to the `expansions` query parameter. Use this expansion with the `list.fields` field parameter when requesting additional fields to complete the primary List object and `user.fields` to complete the expansion object.

### Media

Media refers to any image, GIF, or video attached to a Tweet. The media object is not a primary object on any endpoint, but can be found and expanded in the Tweet object. The object is available for expansion with `?expansions=attachments.media_keys` to get the condensed object with only default fields. Use the expansion with the field parameter: `media.fields` when requesting additional fields to complete the object.

**Retrieving a place object**

**Sample Request**

In the following request, we are requesting fields for the place object attached to the Tweet on the [Tweets lookup](/x-api/posts/lookup/introduction) endpoint. Since place is a child object of a Tweet, the `geo.place_id` expansion is required. Be sure to replace `$BEARER_TOKEN` with your own generated [Bearer Token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#bearer-token-also-known-as-app-only).

```bash
curl --request GET 'https://api.x.com/2/tweets?ids=1136048014974423040&expansions=geo.place_id&place.fields=contained_within,country,country_code,full_name,geo,id,name,place_type' --header 'Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN'
```

### Direct Message events

Direct Message (DM) conversations are made up of events. The X API v2 currently supports three event types: MessageCreate, ParticipantsJoin, and ParticipantsLeave.

DM event objects are returned by the [Direct Message lookup](/x-api/direct-messages/lookup/introduction) endpoints, and a MessageCreate event is created when Direct Messages are successfully created with the [Manage Direct Messages](/x-api/direct-messages/lookup/introduction) endpoints.

When requesting DM events, there are three default event object attributes, or fields, included: id, event_type, and text. To receive additional event fields, use the [fields](/x-api/fundamentals/fields) parameter dm_event.fields to select others. Other available event fields include the following: dm\_conversation\_id, created_at, sender_id, attachments, participant_ids, and referenced_tweets.

Several of these fields provide the IDs of other X objects related to the Direct Message event:

* sender_id - The ID of the account that sent the message, or who invited a participant to a group conversation
* partricipants_ids - An array of account IDs. For ParticipantsJoin and ParticipantsLeave events this array will contain a single ID of the account that created the event
* attachments - Provides media IDs for content that has been uploaded to Twitter by the sender
* referenced_tweets - If a Tweet URL is found in the text field, the ID of that Tweet is included in the response

The sender_id, participant_ids, referenced_tweets.id, and attachments.media_keys [expansions](/x-api/fundamentals/expansions) are available to expand on these Twitter object IDs.

|     |     |     |     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Field value** | **Type** | **Description** | **How it can be used** |
| id (default) | string | The unique identifier of the event.<br/><br/>"id": "1050118621198921728" | Use this to programmatically retrieve a specific conversation event (available with v1.1 endpoints). |
| event_type (default) | string | Describes the type of event. Three types are currently supported: <br/><br/>* MessageCreate<br/>    <br/>* ParticipantsJoin<br/>    <br/>* ParticipantsLeave<br/>    <br/><br/>"event_type": "MessageCreate" | When retrieving a conversation's history, understanding when messages were created, and for group conversations, understanding when participants joined and left. All GET methods support filtering on specific event types with the event_type= query parameter. . |
| text (default) | string | The actual UTF-8 text of the Direct Message. <br/><br/>"text": "Hello, just you!" | With chatbots, this can be used to analyze message contents and determining automated responses. Could be used to build conversation search features. |
| entities          | object | Entities that have been parsed out of the text of the DM.                                       | Provides additional information about hashtags, URLs, mentions, etc. |
| sender_id | string | ID of the User creating the event. To expand this object in the response, include sender_id as an expansion  and use the user.fields query parameter to specify User object attributes of interest.<br/><br/>"sender_id": "906948460078698496" | Retrieve the User object of who created the MessageCreate or ParticipantsJoin event. |
| participant_ids | array (of strings) | IDs of the participants joining and leaving a group conversation. Also used when creating new group conversations. To expand this object in the response, include participant_ids as an expansion and use the user.fields query parameter to specify User object attributes of interest.<br/><br/>"participant_ids": \[<br/><br/>     "906948460078698496"<br/><br/>\] | Used to retrieve User objects for participants joining and leaving group conversations. |
| dm\_conversation\_id | string | The unique identifier of the conversation the event is apart of.<br/><br/>"dm\_conversation\_id": "1584988213961031680" | Use this to programmatically retrieve events from a conversation, and add Direct Messages to it. |
| created_at | date (ISO 8601) | Creation time (UTC) of the Tweet.<br/><br/>"created_at": "2019-06-04T23:12:08.000Z" | This field can be used to understand when a Direct Message was created or when conversation participants joined or left. |
| referenced_tweets | array | ID for any Tweet mentioned in the Direct Message text. To expand this object in the response, include referenced_tweets.id as an expansion and use the tweet.fields query parameter to specify Tweet object attributes of interest.<br/><br/>"referenced_tweets": \[<br/><br/>    <br/><br/>"id": "1578868150510456833"<br/><br/>    <br/><br/>\] | When Direct Messages reference a Tweet, these IDs can be used to lookup the Tweet's details. |
| attachments | object | For Direct Messages with attached Media, provides the media key of the uploaded content (photo, video, or GIF). To expand this object in the response, include attachments.media_keys as an expansion and use the media.fields query parameter to specify media object attributes of interest. Currently, one attachment is supported. <br/><br/>"attachments": <br/><br/>    "media_keys": \[<br/><br/>        "3_1136048009270239232"<br/><br/>    \]<br/><br/> | Understanding the media objects attached to Direct Messages. |

**Retrieving a Direct Message event object**

**Sample Request**

For this example, we will build a request that retrieves events associated with a one-to-one conversation. This request will return fundamental Direct Message event fields, along with additional fields for referenced Tweets and their authors. Let's build a query that asks for:

* Fundamental event attributes such as when it was created and what conversation it is part of (dm_conversation).
* The account ID and description of who sent the Direct Message.
* The text of any referenced Tweet, and when it was posted.
* The account ID and description of any referenced Tweet author.

To return those attributes, your request query would include the following:

      `?dm_event.fields=id,sender_id,text,created_at,dm_conversation_id&expansions=sender_id,referenced_tweets.id&tweet.fields=created_at,text,author_id&user.fields=description`


      ```bash
      curl --request GET 'https://api.x.com/2/dm_conversations/with/:participant_id/dm_events?tweet.fields=created_at,text,author_id&user.fields=description&expansions=sender_id,participant_ids,referenced_tweets.id&dm_event.fields=id,sender_id,text,participant_ids,created_at,'
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN'
    ```

Be sure to replace $BEARER_TOKEN with your own generated [Bearer Token](/resources/fundamentals/authentication#using-and-generating-an-app-only-bearer-token).

### Community

Communities are dedicated places for X users to connect, share, and get closer to the discussions they care about most.

Posts in Communities can be seen by anyone on X, but only others within the Community itself can engage and participate in the discussion.

The Community object contains relevant metadata about a Community.

## How to use fields and expansions

By default, the X API v2 data objects include a small number of default fields when making a request without the use of the [fields](/x-api/fundamentals/fields) or [expansions](/x-api/fundamentals/expansions) parameters. This guide will show you how to use the `fields` and `expansions` query parameters in your request to receive additional objects and fields in your response.

In this guide, we will be requesting several fields in the following Tweet screenshot.
 

 ![This image includes a screenshot of a Tweet posted by @X. You can see the Tweet text, username, published date and time, source, and public metrics. It also includes a video. ](https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/developer-twitter/ScreenShotDataDictionaryGuide.png.twimg.1920.png)

As you can see in the screenshot, there are several visible pieces of information related to the Tweet, including the Tweet author, Tweet metrics, created timestamp, video, and video view count. There are also several pieces of data that are not visible within the screenshot, but are still available to request. 

When making a request to the API, the default response is simple, containing only the default Tweet fields (id and text). You will also only receive the primary object that returns with the given endpoint that you are using, and not any of the associated data objects that might relate to the primary object.

This simplicity, along with the fields and expansions parameters, enable you to request only those fields you require, depending on your use case. 
 

#### Requesting additional fields and objects.

First off, we will be requesting a [Tweet object](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#tweet) using a Tweet ID and the [GET /tweets endpoint](/x-api/posts/lookup/introduction).

Request:

      ```bash
      curl --request GET --url 'https://api.x.com/2/tweets?ids=1260294888811347969' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN'
  ```

Response:

      ```
      {
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "1260294888811347969",
            "text": "Don’t miss the Tweets about your Tweet. \n\nNow on iOS, you can see Retweets with comments all in one place. https://t.co/oanjZfzC6y"
        }
    ]
}
```


The following step-by-step guide will show you how to retrieve the additional data we can see in the screenshot.

1.  Identify the additional fields that you would like to request by using our [object model](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#tweet), or by reviewing the list of fields in the endpoints’ API reference pages.

    In this case, we will be requesting the following additional fields:
    attachments, author_id, created_at, public_metrics.


2.  Build the `tweet.fields` query parameter with the above fields as its value using a comma-separated list:
    `?tweet.fields=attachments,author_id,created_at,public_metrics`

3.  Add the query parameter to the GET /tweets request that you made earlier.

Request:

      `curl --request GET --url 'https://api.x.com/2/tweets?ids=1260294888811347969&tweet.fields=attachments,author_id,created_at,public_metrics' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN'`

Response:
 

      ```
      {
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "1260294888811347969",
            "text": "Don’t miss the Tweets about your Tweet. \n\nNow on iOS, you can see Retweets with comments all in one place. https://t.co/oanjZfzC6y",
            "author_id": "783214",
            "public_metrics": {
                "retweet_count": 5219,
                "reply_count": 1828,
                "like_count": 17141,
                "quote_count": 3255
            },
            "attachments": {
                "media_keys": [
                    "13_1260294804770041858"
                ]
            },
            "created_at": "2020-05-12T19:44:51.000Z"
        }
    ]
}
```



4. Next, we are going to request fields related to the video that was included in the Tweet. To do so, we will use the `expansions` parameter with `attachments.media_keys` as the value, and add this to the request.

?expansions=attachments.media_keys

Request:
 

      ```bash
      curl --request GET --url 'https://api.x.com/2/tweets?ids=1260294888811347969&tweet.fields=attachments,author_id,created_at,public_metrics&expansions=attachments.media_keys' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN'
  ```

Response, with the media object represented in the includes object:
 

  ```
    {
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "1260294888811347969",
            "text": "Don’t miss the Tweets about your Tweet. \n\nNow on iOS, you can see Retweets with comments all in one place. https://t.co/oanjZfzC6y",
            "public_metrics": {
                "retweet_count": 5219,
                "reply_count": 1828,
                "like_count": 17141,
                "quote_count": 3255
            },
            "created_at": "2020-05-12T19:44:51.000Z",
            "attachments": {
                "media_keys": [
                    "13_1260294804770041858"
                ]
            },
            "author_id": "783214"
        }
    ],
    "includes": {
        "media": [
            {
                "media_key": "13_1260294804770041858",
                "type": "video"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```



5. And finally, we are going to request the view count and duration of the video. These aren’t default fields so we have to specifically request them. Use the `media.fields` parameter with the comma-separated values, `public_metrics` and `duration_ms` in your request.

?media.fields=public\_metrics,duration\_ms


Request:
 

      `curl --request GET --url 'https://api.x.com/2/tweets?ids=1260294888811347969&tweet.fields=attachments,author_id,created_at,public_metrics&expansions=attachments.media_keys&media.fields=duration_ms,public_metrics' --header 'Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN'`


Response, which now includes all the data that can be seen in the Tweet screenshot:
 

  ```
  {
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "1260294888811347969",
            "text": "Don’t miss the Tweets about your Tweet. \n\nNow on iOS, you can see Retweets with comments all in one place. https://t.co/oanjZfzC6y",
            "author_id": "783214",
            "public_metrics": {
                "retweet_count": 5219,
                "reply_count": 1828,
                "like_count": 17141,
                "quote_count": 3255
            },
            "created_at": "2020-05-12T19:44:51.000Z",
            "attachments": {
                "media_keys": [
                    "13_1260294804770041858"
                ]
            }
        }
    ],
    "includes": {
        "media": [
            {
                "duration_ms": 36503,
                "media_key": "13_1260294804770041858",
                "public_metrics": {
                    "view_count": 1534703
                },
                "type": "video"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```


In total, we included the following parameters in this example:

* ids=1260294888811347969
* tweet.fields=attachments,author\_id,created\_at,public_metrics
* expansions=attachments.media_keys
* media.fields=public\_metrics,duration\_ms
     

When tied together, here is what the full query string looks like:

```
?ids=1260294888811347969&tweet.fields=attachments,author\_id,created\_at,public\_metrics&expansions=attachments.media\_keys&media.fields=public\_metrics,duration\_ms
```
