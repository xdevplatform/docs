The X API uses standard HTTP status codes. Successful requests return 2xx codes; errors return 4xx or 5xx codes with details in the response body.

---

## HTTP status codes

### Success codes

| Code | Meaning | Description |
|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| **200** | OK | Request successful |
| **201** | Created | Resource created (POST requests) |
| **204** | No Content | Success with no response body (DELETE requests) |

### Client error codes

| Code | Meaning | Common causes |
|:-----|:--------|:--------------|
| **400** | Bad Request | Invalid JSON, malformed query, missing required parameters |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing authentication credentials |
| **403** | Forbidden | Valid auth but no permission for this resource or action |
| **404** | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist or has been deleted |
| **409** | Conflict | Stream has no rules (filtered stream only) |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | Rate limit or usage cap exceeded |

### Server error codes

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|:-----|:--------|:-----------|
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Wait and retry; check [status page](/status) |
| **502** | Bad Gateway | Wait and retry |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | X is overloaded; wait and retry |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout | Wait and retry |

## Error response format

Error responses include structured details:

```json
{
  "title": "Invalid Request",
  "detail": "The 'query' parameter is required.",
  "type": "https://api.x.com/2/problems/invalid-request"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `type` | URI identifying the error type |
| `title` | Short error description |
| `detail` | Specific explanation for this error |

Additional fields may be present depending on the error type.

---

## Error types

| Type | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `about:blank` | Generic error (see HTTP status code) |
| `.../invalid-request` | Malformed request or invalid parameters |
| `.../resource-not-found` | Post, user, or other resource doesn't exist |
| `.../not-authorized-for-resource` | No access to private/protected content |
| `.../client-forbidden` | App not enrolled or lacks required access |
| `.../usage-capped` | Usage cap exceeded |
| `.../rate-limit-exceeded` | Rate limit exceeded |
| `.../streaming-connection` | Stream connection problem |
| `.../rule-cap` | Too many filtered stream rules |
| `.../invalid-rules` | Rule syntax error |
| `.../duplicate-rules` | Rule already exists |

---

## Partial errors

Some requests can partially succeed. A 200 response may include both `data` and `errors`:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {"id": "123", "text": "Hello"}
  ],
  "errors": [
    {
      "resource_id": "456",
      "resource_type": "tweet",
      "title": "Not Found Error",
      "detail": "Could not find tweet with id: [456].",
      "type": "https://api.x.com/2/problems/resource-not-found"
    }
  ]
}
```

This happens when requesting multiple resources and some are unavailable.

## Troubleshooting common errors

<Accordion title="401 Unauthorized">
**Check your authentication:**
- Verify you're using the correct authentication method for the endpoint
- Ensure credentials haven't been regenerated
- Check the `Authorization` header format
- For OAuth 1.0a, verify signature calculation

[Authentication guide →](/resources/fundamentals/authentication/overview)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="403 Forbidden">
**Check your access:**
- Verify your app has access to this endpoint
- Some endpoints require specific enrollment or approval
- User-context endpoints need appropriate OAuth scopes
- The resource may be private or protected
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests">
**Rate limited:**
- Check `x-rate-limit-reset` header for when to retry
- Implement exponential backoff
- Consider caching responses
- Spread requests across the time window

[Rate limits guide →](/x-api/fundamentals/rate-limits)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="400 Bad Request">
**Fix your request:**
- Validate JSON syntax
- Check for missing required parameters
- Verify parameter types (strings vs. numbers)
- Escape special characters in queries
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing expected posts">
**Check these factors:**
- Protected accounts' posts are only visible with authorization
- Deleted posts return 404
- Some posts are withheld in certain regions
- Verify search query syntax is correct
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stream disconnections">
**Handle reconnection:**
- Implement automatic reconnect with backoff
- Use recovery features for missed data
- Check for full-buffer disconnects (client not consuming fast enough)
- Verify at least one stream rule exists

[Streaming guide →](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream/integrate/handling-disconnections)
</Accordion>

## Rate limit headers

Every response includes rate limit information:

```
x-rate-limit-limit: 900
x-rate-limit-remaining: 847
x-rate-limit-reset: 1705420800
```

| Header | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `x-rate-limit-limit` | Max requests in current window |
| `x-rate-limit-remaining` | Requests remaining |
| `x-rate-limit-reset` | Unix timestamp when window resets |

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Check status codes" icon="square-check">
    Always check HTTP status before parsing the response body.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Handle partial errors" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Check for `errors` array even in 200 responses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Implement retry logic" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Use exponential backoff for 429 and 5xx errors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Log request details" icon="file-lines">
    Include request ID and timestamp for debugging.
  </Card>
