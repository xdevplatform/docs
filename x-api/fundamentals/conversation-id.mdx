Every reply on X belongs to a conversation thread. The `conversation_id` field lets you identify, track, and reconstruct entire conversation trees.

---

## How it works

When someone posts and others reply, all replies share the same `conversation_id`—the ID of the original post that started the conversation.

```mermaid actions={false}
flowchart TD
    A["Original post (ID: 1234567890)<br/>← conversation_id for all replies"] --> B["Reply 1 (ID: 1234567891)<br/>conversation_id: 1234567890"]
    A --> C["Reply 2 (ID: 1234567892)<br/>conversation_id: 1234567890"]
    B --> D["Reply to Reply 1<br/>conversation_id: 1234567890"]
    C --> E["Reply to Reply 2<br/>conversation_id: 1234567890"]
```

No matter how deep the thread goes, all posts share the same `conversation_id`.

---

## Requesting conversation_id

Add `conversation_id` to your `tweet.fields`:

```bash
curl "https://api.x.com/2/tweets/1234567891?tweet.fields=conversation_id,in_reply_to_user_id,referenced_tweets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1234567891",
    "text": "@user Great point!",
    "conversation_id": "1234567890",
    "in_reply_to_user_id": "2244994945",
    "referenced_tweets": [{
      "type": "replied_to",
      "id": "1234567890"
    }]
  }
}
```

---

## Getting a full conversation

Use `conversation_id` as a search operator to retrieve all posts in a thread:

```bash
curl "https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/recent?\
query=conversation_id:1234567890&\
tweet.fields=author_id,created_at,in_reply_to_user_id&\
expansions=author_id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

This returns all replies to the original post, sorted reverse-chronologically.

Build the full conversation tree:

```python
import requests

conversation_id = "1234567890"
url = f"https://api.x.com/2/tweets/search/recent"
params = {
    "query": f"conversation_id:{conversation_id}",
    "tweet.fields": "author_id,in_reply_to_user_id,referenced_tweets,created_at",
    "max_results": 100
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
replies = response.json()["data"]

# Sort by created_at to get chronological order
replies.sort(key=lambda x: x["created_at"])
```

## Notes

- The original post's `conversation_id` equals its own `id`
- `conversation_id` is available on all v2 endpoints that return posts
- Use with [filtered stream](/x-api/posts/filtered-stream/introduction) to monitor conversations in real-time
- Combine with [pagination](/x-api/fundamentals/pagination) for large threads
