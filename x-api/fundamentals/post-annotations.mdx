Annotations provide semantic metadata about post content. X analyzes posts to identify entities (people, places, products) and context (topics, domains) to help you understand and filter content.

---

## Annotation types

### Entity annotations

Named-entity recognition (NER) identifies specific mentions in post text:

| Type | Examples |
|:-----|:---------|
| **Person** | Barack Obama, Elon Musk |
| **Place** | San Francisco, Japan |
| **Product** | iPhone, ChatGPT |
| **Organization** | NASA, Google |
| **Other** | Super Bowl, Diabetes |

Entity annotations include a confidence score and position in the text.

### Context annotations

Semantic analysis that classifies posts by topic and domain:

- **Domain**: Broad category (Sports, Entertainment, Technology)
- **Entity**: Specific topic within the domain (NBA, Marvel Movies, AI)

Context annotations help filter and categorize posts without relying on keywords.

## Requesting annotations

Add `context_annotations` and `entities` to your `tweet.fields`:

```bash
curl "https://api.x.com/2/tweets/1234567890?tweet.fields=context_annotations,entities" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Response structure

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1234567890",
    "text": "Just saw the new Marvel movie - it was amazing!",
    "entities": {
      "annotations": [
        {
          "start": 17,
          "end": 22,
          "probability": 0.9234,
          "type": "Organization",
          "normalized_text": "Marvel"
        }
      ]

## Using annotations in filters

### Search and filtered stream

Filter posts by context annotation entity ID:

```bash
# Posts about a specific entity
context:86.1234567890

# Posts in a specific domain
context:86.*
```

### Practical examples

```bash
# Posts about the NBA
query=context:26.852137520

# Posts about Apple products
query=context:47.10026792024

# Posts about movies
query=context:86.*
```

## Language support

Annotations are available for multiple languages:

| Language | Coverage |
|:---------|:---------|
| English | Highest |
| Japanese | High |
| Spanish | High |
| Portuguese | Medium |
| French | Medium |
| Hindi | Medium |

Coverage varies by domain and market.

## Important notes

<Warning>
**Not all posts are annotated.** Annotation coverage depends on:
- Language support
- Topic coverage in X's taxonomy
- Semantic richness of the post text
</Warning>

- Annotations are not retroactive—only applied when entities are tracked
- The same entity can appear in multiple domains (e.g., a celebrity is both Person and Actor)
- Entity IDs are stable across domains
