## Organic vs. promoted metrics

If a post was promoted as an ad, metrics split between organic and promoted views:

| Context | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Organic** | Metrics from normal timeline views |
| **Promoted** | Metrics from paid ad impressions |
| **Public** | Combined total (organic + promoted) |

Request both to see the breakdown:

```bash
tweet.fields=public_metrics,organic_metrics,promoted_metrics
```

## Metric definitions

<Accordion title="Impressions">
Count of times the post appeared on a user's screen. Not unique—the same user viewing twice counts as two impressions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Repost count">
Number of reposts (retweets). Does not include quote posts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quote count">
Number of quote posts (reposts with comment). These are always organic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Video views">
Aggregated across all posts containing the video. A video reposted in multiple posts has one total view count.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Playback quartiles">
Number of unique users who played through each percentage of the video. Useful for understanding drop-off rates.
</Accordion>
