The Stream Connections endpoints let you retrieve the history of your application's streaming connections and terminate active or multiple connections. Use these to monitor connection status, resolve issues like duplicate connections, and manage streaming sessions for endpoints like Filtered Stream and Sampled Stream.

<Note>
These endpoints require [Bearer Token authentication](/fundamentals/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) and are available for apps with access to streaming endpoints.
