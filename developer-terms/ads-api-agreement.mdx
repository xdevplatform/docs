Collectively, these Individual Products are referred to herein as the “**Ads Products**”.

X may monitor Company’s use of the X Ads API to improve the X Services.

### 5. Control of Allocation of X Ads Inventory.

For clarity, and without limiting the generality of any other term or condition of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is meant to represent or imply that Company or the Company Service will have access, via the X Ads API, to any particular inventory or category of X Ads, and X may (in its sole and absolute discretion) elect from time to time, to limit, without restriction, the allocation of X Ads inventory to which Company or the Company Service has access (e.g., without limitation, due to X’s strategic decisions concerning sales channels, direct vs. non-direct client relationships, agency relationships, etc.).

### 6. Control of X Ads Features, API Calls and Functionality.

For clarity, and without limiting the generality of any other term or condition of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is meant to represent or imply that Company or the Company Service will have access, via the X Ads API, to any particular X Ads feature, API call or functionality, and X may (in its sole and absolute discretion) elect from time to time, to limit, without restriction, those X Ads features, API calls and/or functionalities to which Company or the Company Service has access (for any or no reason).

### 7. Geography Data.

Company will not (and will not allow others to) use or access the X Ads API to aggregate, cache or store place or other geographic location information contained in any Data or otherwise.

### 8. Removals.

When requested by X, through the X Ads API or otherwise, Company will promptly: (a) delete Data from the Company Service that X reports as deleted or expired; (b) change Company’s treatment of Data that X reports is subject to changed sharing options; and (c) modify Data on the Company Service that X reports has been modified. Company is responsible for the quality of X Ads transmitted to the X Service by the Company Service. X reserves the right to revoke access to the X Ads API and/or, if applicable, remove any specific X Ads from the X Service for any objectionable use by Company or Clients.

### 9. Updates.

Company acknowledges that X may update or modify the X Ads API, from time to time, and in X’s sole and absolute discretion (in each instance, an “**Update**”). Unless otherwise mutually agreed by X and Company in advance in writing (email to suffice), Company is required to implement and use the most current version of the X Ads API and to make any changes to the Company Service, at Company’s sole cost and expense, that are required as a result of such Update no later than thirty (30) days from the date that X notifies Company of the Update. Company will implement all tools (if any) provided by X to enable Updates, as applicable.

Company’s continued access or use of the X Ads API following any such Update will constitute binding acceptance of the Update.

### 10. Support.

X is not obligated to provide support or technical assistance directly to Company or any Clients or any of their End Users, and Company will not represent to any Clients or any of their End Users that X is available to provide such support.

## Exhibit A-1: Product Requirements

The Company Service should enable marketers to more efficiently optimize X Ads campaigns, take advantage of X’s real-time conversation, and develop X Ads that improve the user experience.

Accordingly, the Company Service, at all times, will meet the following requirements:

### 1. Product Pricing. No Monetization.

Paid access to the Company Service must be priced on a fixed or variable percentage of spend fee structure. Company will not charge Clients a premium for access to X Ads and/or Data through the Company Service in excess of Company’s standard rates for the Company Service.

### 2. Transparency.

**2.1 Spend.**

2.1.1 Any pricing reports delivered by Company to Clients and their End Users must clearly state and itemize (i) the X Ads spend in X’s native metrics (e.g., as applicable, CPE/CPF) and (ii) the fees charged for use of the Company Service. In addition, Company must always include CPE or CPF metrics (or other applicable X native metrics) adjacent to last-click attribution metrics (e.g., CPC) or other reporting metrics (e.g. CPM).

2.1.2 Company Service will include a self-serve reporting dashboard that will include the capability for Company to report on all metrics provided via the X Ads API.

**2.2 Data.** Company will: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain up-to-date Data within the Company Service in connection with the X Integration (defined below in Section 6.3 of this Exhibit A-1) in accordance with the then-current Analytics Data Display Requirements; and (ii) clearly disclose to Clients and their End Users any material delay inherent in any information regarding Client’s X Ads Campaigns and/or related analytics data.

### 3. Accounts.

Each End User must be given a separate account to access the Company Service, including a unique user name and password.

Each customized version of the Company Service for a specific Client (including, without limitation, a white-labeled version of Company Service for a specific Client) must be approved by X in advance and in writing (email to suffice for such purposes).

### 5. Clients and Account Management.

**5.1** A Client must be given the ability to quickly and easily disassociate its X Ads Campaigns from the Company Service and regain exclusive, direct control of its X Ads account(s).

**5.2** Only a Client and its End Users may be allowed to view such Client’s account data or features via the Company Service.

### 6. Other Requirements.

**6.1** Any Company Service functionality that replicates a X feature will utilize X’s naming nomenclature and feature names, subject to any applicable X Trademark Guidelines.

**6.2** Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in advance and in writing, Company will not provide Clients and their End Users or any other third party with access to Data except for the aggregated derivations of such material embodied in the user interface of the Company Service.

**6.3** Company may not commercialize, market or provide access to any X Materials to any third parties (including any Clients or their End Users) until the implementation of the X Ads API and integration and display of any Data within Company Service (collectively, the “**X Integration**”) has been approved in advance by X via the process described in this Section. Company will give X access to the Company Service so that X can review the X Integration. X will inform Company in writing (email being sufficient) if the X Integration is approved or rejected (in X’s sole discretion). Throughout the Term, Company will submit to X any changes to the Company Service that affect the X Integration, which X shall have the right to approve or reject in writing (email being sufficient), in X’s sole discretion.

## Exhibit A-2: Analytics Data Display Requirements

These Analytics Data Display Requirements govern how Company can display Data within the Company Service. Company agrees to abide by these Analytics Data Display Requirements at all times.

### Defined Metrics

All campaigns shown in the Company Service that display Data must include the specific X-defined metrics associated with various campaign objectives (each, a “**Campaign Objective**”), which metrics must be calculated by Company based on the endpoints and formulas located at: [https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-ads-api/analytics/overview/metrics-by-objective](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-ads-api/analytics/overview/metrics-by-objective) (or any other successor URL that X may elect from time to time). 

### Display Guidelines

**1.** The applicable defined metrics for a given Campaign Objective (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this Exhibit A-2) must be shown every time a campaign is displayed within the Company Service.

**2.** If the Company Service displays any organic post analytics data, Company must comply with the X Developer Agreement & Policy located at: [https://docs.x.com/developer-terms/agreement](/developer-terms/agreement) as it relates to Company’s implementation, use and display of the organic post analytics data.

**3.** If the Company Service displays metrics about campaigns run on third party networks or by third party publishers (i.e., “cross-channel metrics”) side-by-side with Data, then the following requirements and restrictions apply:

**3.1** Any cross-channel metrics displayed alongside the Data in the Company Service can only include the same category of campaign objective metrics as the applicable X-defined Campaign Objective metrics for such campaign (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this Exhibit A-2).

By way of example only - If an advertiser is running an app install campaign on a third-party network, only cross-channel metrics that are of the same category as the applicable X-defined metrics for the app install Campaign Objective can be shown alongside the Data.

**3.2** Aggregating data to display cross-channel metrics is not permitted unless the aggregated metrics can be referenced (across all third-party networks/publishers) against a category of metrics associated with a campaign objective that is the same to the applicable X-defined Campaign Objective metrics (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this Exhibit A-2). By way of example only - Aggregating total engagements for network A, network B, and network C would not be permitted if engagement rates across all channels are not calculated using the same formulas.

**4.** If the Company Service displays any category of metrics sourced from third parties other than X (“**third-party-sourced metrics**”), then the following requirements and restrictions apply:

**4.1** The same requirements and restrictions that apply to displaying cross-channel metrics set forth above in Section 3 apply to the display of any third-party-sourced metrics.

**4.2.** Any third-party-sourced metrics that are displayed alongside Data for a campaign in the Company Service must be the same category of campaign objective metrics as the applicable X-defined Campaign Objective metrics for such campaign (as described above in the Defined Metrics section of this Exhibit A-2). By way of example only:

- If Company displays link click and click-rate metrics from a third-party source, Company will display X’s click and click-rate metrics alongside the third-party-sourced link click and click rate metrics. 

- If Company or any of its Clients uses a third-party tracking solution to track website clicks from Promoted posts and such data is displayed in the Company Service, Company must show link clicks, click rate, cost per link click and CPA from X (if available) alongside such third-party-sourced data.

**4.3** Notwithstanding Section 4.2 of this Exhibit A-2, if the third-party-sourced metrics are from a third-party tracking solution provided by a X Conversion Tracking Partner (as defined below), then X requires that only the Data delivered through the X Ads API (and not any corresponding data delivered by the X Conversion Tracking Partner) is displayed in the Company Service, unless otherwise agreed by X in writing in advance (in each instance). For the avoidance of doubt, Company will not display any data sourced from a X Conversion Tracking Partner alongside, or in place of, any Data delivered through the X Ads API. As used in this Exhibit A-2, “**X Conversion Tracking Partner**” means an authorized X conversion tracking partner (as designated by X, in its sole and absolute discretion).

## Exhibit B: Individual Product Terms/Custom Audiences

Capitalized terms not defined in these Individual Product Terms have the meaning set forth in the main body of the Agreement. To the extent that Company uses or accesses the X Custom Audiences Program the following terms and conditions of this Exhibit B will apply:

### 1. Custom Audiences.

**1.1 Introduction.** The X Custom Audiences Program allows for the import and creation of specific segments of users (each a “**Custom Audience**”) for the targeting of advertising Campaigns on the X Service. The parties acknowledge that in order to utilize X Custom Audiences Program, Company, its Client, or a third party service provided approved by X (“**Data Partner**”) is required to provide X with a hashed set of users or devices (which many include email, cookies, devise IDs, tracking pixels, etc.) in order for X to complete a match with X users and create Custom Audiences. The Custom Audiences created on behalf of a specific client(s) will be stored in each such Client’s X Ads account for use by Company or Client to target, or retarget, as applicable, advertising on the X Service.

**1.2 Data Usage and Opt-Out.** With respect to any data used in connection with the Custom Audiences Program, in addition to the obligations set out in the Data Protection Addendum found at [https://privacy.x.com/en/for-our-partners/global-dpa](https://privacy.x.com/en/for-our-partners/global-dpa), Company agrees and, if applicable, will ensure that its Data Partner(s) agree that (i) Company or such Data Partner (as applicable) have secured all necessary rights, consents, waivers, licenses for use of such data, and (ii) that Company or such Data Partner (as applicable) have provided any users from whom the data is collected with legally-sufficient notice that fully discloses the collection, use, and sharing of the data Company provides to X for purposes of serving ads targeting to users’ interests, and legally sufficient instructions on how users can opt out of X’s interest-based advertising through the methods described here ([https://help.x.com/safety-and-security/privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads](https://help.x.com/safety-and-security/privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads)). Data Company uses in connection with the Custom Audiences Program and/or to create a Custom Audience will not include any data from any user who has opted out of having his/her data used by Company, its Data Partner, or any third party on Company’s behalf. If Company receives a user opt-out after such user was included in an audience provided to X, Company must promptly, but no less frequently than once every twenty-four (24) hours, remove such user(s) from any Custom Audience in which such user was included. Company will provide the data in a format selected by X and acceptable to Data Partner (if/as applicable). In addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company’s use of X Custom Audiences program will be subject to the terms of the [X Master Services Agreement](https://legal.x.com/ads-terms.html) and Custom Audiences Program T&Cs and applicable policies, including X’s Policies for Conversion Tracking and Custom Audiences, at [https://legal.x.com/ads-terms.html](https://legal.x.com/ads-terms.html) and [https://business.x.com/en/help/ads-policies/campaign-considerations/policies-for-conversion-tracking-and-custom-audiences](https://business.x.com/en/help/ads-policies/campaign-considerations/policies-for-conversion-tracking-and-custom-audiences).

**1.3 Additional Program Requirements.** Company’s access to, and use of, the X Custom Audience Program is additionally subject to its compliance with the technical instructions and program policies provided by X to Company (the “**Program Integration Spec**”). Company and X will mutually agree on a process for Company to import or upload Custom Audiences to X.

### 2. Shareable Audiences.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 1.1 hereinabove, as a service to Company, at Company’s request and in Company’s sole discretion, X may allow Company to “share” Custom Audiences created for Company amongst grouped X advertiser accounts and/or X @handles and/or otherwise with third parties on the X Service. As used herein, “sharing” an audience means that Company would instruct X to, without limitation, enable grouped X Advertiser Accounts and/or X @handles and/or third parties to access, use, and target advertising Campaigns against the “shared” Custom Audience. Company represents and warrants that it has all necessary rights and authority to share any such audience data in accordance with the instructions given to X by Company. If Company is providing the audience data, and/or managing the Custom Audiences on behalf of a third party (including, without limitation, a Client), Company represents and warrants that Company has the authority as agent for such party to use any such data on the third party’s behalf, to grant X the rights described herein, and to bind such third party to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section requires X to make the functionality that enables “sharing” Custom Audiences described herein (or any portion thereof) available at any time to Company or any other third party (including, without limitation, any Client).
